- en: On October 12, 1997, John Denver, popular folk singer and amateur pilot, at
    the controls of a newly-purchased experimental aircraft, died after crashing into
    Monterey Bay, in California. He died in an aircraft that had already done its
    best to kill two previous pilots, an aircraft with a human interface flaw so fundamental,
    so profound, that it finally managed to kill.

- en: The Long EZ is a kit aircraft designed by Burt Rutan, one of the world's greatest
    aerospace designers. Rutan was responsible for the Voyager, the first aircraft
    to circumnavigate the globe without refueling. He is currently working on a reusable
    spacecraft for commercial and tourist operations that can fly into space in the
    morning, be checked out and refueled over lunch, and fly again that very afternoon.
    One of his Long EZ planes, similar to John Denver's, holds the altitude record
    for conventional aircraft. It is a brilliant design, and is well respected in
    the aviation community.

- en: Experimental aircraft kits, however, need not be built as the designer intended.
    Indeed, the flaws that led to Denver's death were the work of the builder, and
    had nothing to do with Burt Rutan. These flaws led from the builder's sincere
    desire to improve on Rutan's work, a goal that could actually be said to have
    been accomplished from an engineering perspective, even if it did kill the pilot.

- en: Aircraft are designed to be as safe as possible. This sounds pretty obvious,
    but if you look back to the history of the motorcar, you can see quite a contrast
    with aviation. The car companies required government intervention before adding,
    while still kicking and screaming, such esoteric safety equipment as headlights,
    windshield wipers, and seat belts. The aviation community, on the contrary, from
    the beginning made safety their primary goal.

    breaks under the hood and soon the engine is engulfed in flames. The cure? Pull
    over, get out, find a long stick, and start roasting marshmallows.

- en: That same fire in an aircraft at 10,000 feet is a far more serious affair. It
    can take several minutes to "pull over," during which time that fire can be pouring
    inky black smoke into the cockpit, blinding the pilot, making a crash inevitable.
    As a result, aircraft have fuel shutoff valves in the cockpit. Flip the valve
    and find a nice, friendly field somewhere below where you can safely land your
    plane.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These shutoff valves, on most aircraft, serve a second purpose, letting you
    choose between the tank located in the left wing and the tank located in the right
    wing. (I prefer flying aircraft that also have a "Both" position, so all this
    gas selection can be avoided.)

- en: 'John Denver''s aircraft had a fuel selection valve with only three positions:
    Off, Left, and Right. Burt Rutan''s design called for that valve to be placed
    on the front panel of the aircraft, making it easy to switch among the options.
    The builder of the aircraft, however, elected to place the valve back behind the
    pilot''s left shoulder. He did so with the best of intentions. By placing the
    valve behind the pilot''s compartment, on the other side of the back firewall,
    with only a long rod leading to the handle behind the pilot''s left shoulder,
    he avoided running the gas lines through the passenger compartment, eliminating
    any possibility of a gasline rupture occuring inside the compartment.'

    \ only way to switch tanks was to let go of the controls, twist your head to the\
    \ left to look behind you, reach over your left shoulder with your right hand,\
    \ find the valve, and turn it. As the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)\
    \ discovered, it was difficult to do this without bracing yourself with your right\
    \ foot\x97by pressing the right rudder pedal all the way to the floor. And that's\
    \ what killed John Denver. His plane was seen veering to the right and plunging\
    \ into the ocean from only a few hundred feet up, consistent with the NTSB's reconstruction."

    suggests he made use of two of them:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He had fuel gauges in the rear of the aircraft, behind the pilot, and a mirror
    (!) used to look at them. However, the fuel gauges were not linear and had no
    markings to indicate that apparently half-full was really close to empty.

- en: He dipped a rod into the fuel tanks while pre-checking the plane before flight
    to test the fuel level. He may not have been aware, however, that, because of
    the way the Long-EZ rests, the fuel tends to slosh toward the fuel tank filler
    port, giving a highly-optimistic reading.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The third method is adding fuel to the tanks, which Denver failed to do. Because
    the Long-EZ has very large tanks, the common practice is to add an amount of fuel
    suffient for the flight, plus a healthy margin. It may be John Denver was told
    not to fill the tanks, but was not told of this partial-filling practice.

- en: '**The valve:** The builder not only placed the valve in a non-standard location,
    he also rotated it in such a way that turning the valve to the right turned on
    the left fuel tank. This ensured that a pilot unfamiliar with the aircraft, upon
    hearing the engine begin missing and spotting in his mirror that the left fuel
    tank was empty, would attempt to rotate the fuel valve to the right, away from
    the full tank, guaranteeing his destruction.'

    to appreciate it: Let the User Beware! And, indeed, the NTSB, as per its long
    history of setting aside findings, human factors or otherwise, that might conflict
    with a verdict of pilot error, ruled that the responsibility for this crash lay
    with the pilot. The interface was relegated to a mere "factor." Had John Denver
    fueled his aircraft in spite of evidence indicating he had sufficient fuel, had
    he somehow managed to thoroughly familiarize himself with the idiosyncrasies of
    this uniquely-assembled experimental aircraft *sans* manual, he would be alive
    and well today.'

- en: However, to those of us versed in even rudimentary human factors, it is easy
    to see that the design of this fuel system was a disaster waiting to happen, as
    was borne out not only by what Denver experienced, but by incidents reported by
    two previous pilots of this same plane who almost met death under the same circumstances.
    Presumably, they had a bit more altitude when their fuel starved out and, therefore,
    a bit more time to react.

- en: We in the PC and web worlds have a lot to learn from this, too. We have a lot
    of bad design floating around that is just as perverse as fuel valves that face
    the wrong way, hidden behind firewalls. And it is not all to be found in freeware
    and shareware programs, where one might argue that, as with experimental aircraft,
    "let the user beware." Indeed, some of the most egregious examples of design are
    apparent in the most expensive, mainstream operating systems and applications.
    Fortunately for the corporations behind them, our screw-ups generally don't kill
    people outright. Instead, we specialize in driving our users slowly insane.

    human factors approach their craft, you will end up with designs that are fast,
    familiar, and forgiving. Such designs would be a refreshing change in the ghastly
    world of PC software. They'd be a refreshing change in the world of general aviation,
    too.</csobj>
