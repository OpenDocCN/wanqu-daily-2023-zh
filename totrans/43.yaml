    the cost of producing clothing. Early on, workers needed many days to produce
    a piece of clothing, so they were very expensive and most people couldn’t afford
    them. As automation reduced the human time needed to produce a piece of clothing,
    the cost dropped, and the price dropped too. People could suddenly buy many more
    articles of clothing, which they did, and the overall demand increased so much
    that the industry employed more workers.

    it takes only three days, the labor cost has dropped by 70%, and the overall cost
    might have dropped by 50%. If there’s competition, the price will follow the cost.
    At a 50% cheaper price, customers might buy *four* times as many pieces, spending
    more overall, and the number of workers needed would have increased by 20%.
