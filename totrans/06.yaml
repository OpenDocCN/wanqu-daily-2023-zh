    amount of time that was expected to do the task, leaving the manager befuddled
    - “I wish you hadn’t spent so much time.”

- en: An executive asks a quick question in a meeting “can you check this out for
    me?” This brief ask turns into 24 people preparing 4 versions of a slide deck
    and working over the weekend in preparation of a meeting that now has a career-making
    aura. In that meeting, the exec sees the first slide’s first sentence summary
    and says “oh ok, thanks, no need for a whole presentation.”

    nobody asks what that means. A month later that leader is deeply disappointed
    when a critical project is not being shipped on time: “you said to be modern,
    so we put together a modernization project that focused on a sweeping tech upgrade;
    that pushed out a bunch of other projects.” The leader had meant to say that over
    the course of the next couple years, they needed to refresh the syntax of their
    APIs in a new version.'

    turmoil and wheel-spinning. To combat this, leaders should be very precise with
    the amount of time investment they’re asking for when they ask for things. A little
    bit of awkward precision up front can save major headaches down the line. Here’s
    some examples:'

- en: Do not, DO NOT, assume they are too busy to answer clarifying questions as you
    work on the ask. Dollars are flushed down the drain every day because people incorrectly
    assume leaders don’t have time to clarify their asks. Rooms full of people analyze
    emails and instant messages from the leader like ancient artifacts. Ask the leader
    for clarification - if they have time to ask you to do something, they have time
    to clarify that ask.
