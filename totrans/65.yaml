    one of New York City’s largest dailies, sought to deliver timely news about the
    Mexican-American War. It was, after all, the story of the day, dominating public
    attention. “Has the Mexican War terminated yet, and how? Are we beaten?” a teenage
    Emily Dickinson wrote to her brother, expressing the nation’s inquisitorial mood.

    thousands of miles from the frontline. Could *The Sun* afford to run a relay of

    year, Substack considered raising a Series C at a mooted [$1 billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/26/business/media/substack-venture-capital.html)
    valuation but aborted the process in light of another market shock. “We went to
    sniff the market…and it was perfectly timed for the market turning,” McKenzie
    said. “We were like, ‘Ok, this is not the right idea.’” That volte-face provoked
    widespread coverage emphasizing Substack’s elevated $650 million valuation and
    a reported $9 million in revenue – a figure McKenzie says was incorrect, though
    “not orders of magnitude wrong.” With venture capital off the menu, Substack cut

    send the first-ever edition of The Generalist and being impressed by how easy
    it was to get started, particularly compared to clunky enterprise-focused alternatives

    automations. Historically, design choices have been extremely limited, meaning
    that brand-conscious publishers have few options beyond the color of a few buttons.
    Additionally, publishers on the platform have traditionally struggled with SEO,
    limiting their inbound traffic.

    SEO was extremely important to the business and wanted to build our site’s authority.

    a recent [SEO upgrade](https://on.substack.com/p/the-state-of-seo-on-substack-feb-23)
    seems designed to solve the most pressing issues. Critically, Substack has also
    given much more design control to publishers. It’s now common to see Substacks
    leverage different fonts and background palettes, for example. On a case-by-case
    basis, Substack has worked with some of its largest publications to create more
    extensive, elaborate custom themes. For example, visitors to The Free Press are
    greeted by a site that looks very little like a traditional Substack; the only
    obvious sign of its provenance is the “subscribe” button in the top-left corner.

    has attracted many impressive publications to its platform, it has also seen some
    leave. The Dispatch, for example, [departed in 2022](https://www.therebooting.com/p/why-the-dispatch-is-leaving-substack?triedSigningIn=true),
    opting to build a solution of its own. Beyond economic considerations, I suspect
    part of the rationale would have related to brand control. Indeed, this was a
    key consideration when we thought about moving The Generalist back to Substack.
    Though we’ve started with the platform’s default aesthetic as we get back up to
    speed, I expect us to tweak the visual language and branding to better fit our
    ethos in time. Introducing more flexibility here could persuade fast-growing publishers
    that they don’t need to leave the platform to build a brand.

    giving up $50,000 for an email platform and website sounds absurd. Plenty of alternatives
    exist for a tenth of the cost. However, if that $50,000 platform drives $75,000
    in revenue, using it is sensible and economical. The math is even more attractive
    for publishers that monetize via subscriptions *and* ads.

    may compound. My friend [Ben Butler](https://twitter.com/bengbutler) offered the
    best analogy I’ve heard, comparing Substack to Booking.com and publications to
    various hotels. Though hotel owners may wish to have part of their business or
    brand exist off of travel platforms, they must have at least some presence – the
    sheer volume of traffic and business a player like Booking.com drives cannot be

    quite powerful,” Bill Bishop said. It’s too early to tell whether chat will become
    a vital part of Substack’s offering in its current form – but the company wants

    sound like a small thing, but this specificity feels critical to understand how
    Substack makes its product designs. It’s also an intriguing framing when thinking
    about chat. What does a community platform look like when designed explicitly

    a destination, though my feeling on the matter has changed. Initially, I assumed
    that the larger Substack’s brand became, the more it would seek to minimize and
    commoditize the underlying publications. In many respects, that has been the recent
    history of content networks – Twitter doesn’t want each tweet to have vastly different
    brands, stylizations, or rules. It wants variety in content but uniformity in
    structure. Wouldn’t Substack seek to require The Generalist to adhere to similar
    strictures?
  prefs: []

    as traditional social media platforms because the underlying businesses are fundamentally
    portable. Imagine you’re an Instagram influencer that monetizes via sponsorships.
    If you don’t like how Adam Mosseri manages the platform, what are your options?

    take your audience with you. If a tool or network is no longer serving the company,
    you can make a change – just as The Generalist did this week. As a result, Substack
    cannot overreach even if it wanted to. Even if it were run by mustache-twirling
    villains rather than principled media obsessives, it would be counterproductive
    to exert too much force, to turn the screws too tightly. Instead of doing so,
    as we’ve discussed, Substack has moved in the opposite direction, allowing for
    greater variety and control.

    $50 to $2,000, with a median of $100 and a mean of $234\. Using the latter two

    even more important. Even if that is the case, the demand for B2B publications
    should remain strong and cannot be as well-served by short-form video platforms.
    If you’re a logistics manager, you *might* find a few tips on TikTok, but you’ll
    spend money on a trade publication like [Freight Waves](https://www.freightwaves.com/).
    Though it may become more niche, at least some demand for long-form writing will
    remain for the foreseeable future.

    list of risks. **More frightening is the possibility of reputational damage**.
    As discussed, Substack has weathered plenty of firestorms in its comparatively
    young life, attracting opprobrium from multiple quarters. In some instances, this
    has driven the exit of writers with significant audiences and earning power. So
    far, these movements have been on the mini side – Substack’s executives will want
    to ensure it stays this way.

    means this is always a risk. Media companies tend to like writing about other
    companies, meaning Substack will remain in the spotlight. Because email accounts
    are portable, its customers can depart the platform for substitutes like ConvertKit

    customers**. Recommendations represented a game changer for the ecosystem, propelling
    constituent publishers to new heights with no added effort. While this feature
    can keep bolstering subscriber counts, Substack will want to add other weapons
    to its arsenal just in case that flywheel slows. At some basic level, every successful
    publisher makes the same calculation at the end of the year: did Substack deliver
    more than the 10% it took? Everyone is happy when the answer is yes. However,
    when there’s a deficit, the focus shifts from growth to cost.'

    players. If your newsletter is earning $3 million a year, Substack needs to find
    a way to deliver at least $300,000 in value and hopefully more. If Substack cannot
    do this, it may create a dynamic in which the rational move for the most successful
    publishers is to leave the platform.

    the competition.” To date, Substack has executed that strategy effectively, but
    it may not always be as easily done.

    novels, giving these creators easier ways to build a business around their work.
    The next Cyanide & Happiness or XKCD may be provisioned over email, or shown in

    For example, it could automatically generate summaries of long articles for writers
    to include at the top of a piece – like our actionable insights. With the help
    of voice-skinning platforms, it could upgrade its read-aloud functionality to
    support custom audio; readers would hear articles in the author’s voice. It could
    even take a page from [Lex](https://lex.page/), an AI-powered word processor,
    augmenting its current editor to help publishers work through writer’s block or
    accelerate their process. Fittingly, Lex was created by the newsletter network,
    [Every](https://every.to/), which a former Substack employee co-founded.

    requiring careful prompting. Though the details of Substack’s test have not been
