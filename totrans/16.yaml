- en: Large language models (LLM) like ChatGPT triggered a remarkable societal and
    computational shift that feels comparable to the impact from the initial internet
    era with its first impressive search engines like Google. LLMs are the toast of
    the town.

    would be passed in the past trying to conjure a piece of text that could communicate
    something to another entity. Now this can be made at scale, at low cost, with
    low effort.

    name on the email sender, instead of just sending that email, we might first read
    that LLM output, interpret it, understand it, and then send it.

- en: Text is a form of communication. If something, or someone wrote it for us, certain
    decisions were made along the way to convey the goal that we gave. Out of the
    many paths possible to crystallize that piece of knowledge into a piece text,
    one of them was chosen.

- en: The writing process is more than just the production of text. Many times it
    requires the exploration of different perspectives, thinking deeply and coming
    to terms that we don’t know enough about a subject and need to learn more about
    it.

- en: For example, it’s essential for me to have a notebook at hand to take notes
    during meetings and formal discussions. I write phrases, loose words, make small
    diagrams, jot down some reminders. Some of them are never to be re-read again,
    others I revisit to structure them down into a concise structure. Most of all,
    they help me think about a problem.

- en: Same holds for notes and articles. I start with a cloud of loosely related ideas,
    which I attempt to refine into a structured form. Similar to the [double diamond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Diamond_(design_process_model))
    process.

    about a book read one month before. Or conversations. Or movies. Or experiences.

- en: For me, taking notes helps make sure that I’m really thinking hard about what’s
    in there. If I disagree with the book, sometimes it takes a long time to read
    the books because I’m writing so much in the margin
