    year in Europe we decided to come back to Japan (mixed couple (European/Japanese)
    with a 1 year and a half kid). We already lived a few years in the Tokyo area

    the solution. I always dreamt about the idea but..

    wood using natural paint which is pretty important for us living full-time with
    a small kid.

    cooking time and storage space as every meat/fish is always packed in a lot of
