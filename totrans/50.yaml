- en: 'Sir Stanley Unwin, who founded the great independent house Allen & Unwin, was
    famous for his catchphrase: “The first duty of any publisher to their authors
    is to remain solvent.” He wrote one of the better guides to the book trade, *The
    Truth About Publishing*, and it is amusing that he wrote in his introduction:
    “The publisher’s task is no easy one and the whole process of publication is vastly
    more complicated than it was even a generation ago”. That was in 1926.'

  zh: 创立了伟大的独立出版社Allen & Unwin的斯坦利·昂温爵士以他的口头禅而闻名：“任何出版商对作者的首要责任是保持健康。”他写了一本关于图书贸易的较好指南，*出版业的真相*，有趣的是他在序言中写道：“出版商的任务并不容易，整个出版过程比一个时代前复杂得多。”那是在1926年。
- en: At the risk of being a bore, it is worth stressing that to be solvent, publishers
    must be profitable and —obviously—to be profitable their books must make a profit.
    Even subsidised poetry publishers must adhere to the “Micawber principle”. So
    this article is about numbers, because profit and cashflow are what keep us in
    existence. Like Unwin in his great book, it makes sense to follow the lifecycle
    of a book to see where it incurs costs and where it generates revenue. Every manuscript
    has a long gestation before it enters a publishing house but its existence for
    us begins when an editor wants to acquire it, frequently from a literary agent,
    but even before acquisition the editor is supposed to complete a financial appraisal.
    This is never a popular task.

  zh: 冒着变得乏味的风险，值得强调的是，为了保持健康，出版商必须盈利，而且——显而易见——为了盈利，他们的书籍必须盈利。即使是受资助的诗歌出版商也必须遵循“麦考伯原则”。因此，本文涉及数字，因为利润和现金流是让我们存在的基础。就像Unwin在他的伟大著作中所说的那样，跟踪一本书的生命周期是有意义的，以查看它产生成本和收入的地方。每一份手稿在进入出版社之前都有一个漫长的孕育期，但对我们来说，它的存在始于编辑想要收购它的时候，通常是从文学代理处收购，但即使在收购之前，编辑也应该完成财务评估。这从来不是一项受欢迎的任务。

- en: Our appraisal form at Profile is a five-page Excel workbook. Other publishers’
    appraisal forms are similar, though I have seen some that are much more intimidating.
    The editor must include the advance, the number of pages and formats, the proposed
    retail price, the home and international sales by key market, the rights income
    and marketing costs. This is where most editors are inclined to cheat.

  zh: 我们在Profile的评估表格是一个五页的Excel工作簿。其他出版商的评估表格类似，尽管我见过一些更加令人生畏的。编辑必须包括预付款、页数和格式、建议的零售价格、主要市场的国内和国际销售、版权收入和营销成本。这是大多数编辑倾向于作弊的地方。
- en: Let’s suppose the figures are believable. The house can now make an offer for
    the book. Profile’s offer is always for an advance against royalties (and rights
    income if the publisher is taking, say, translation rights). In theory, publishers
    pitch advances at a level that will be covered by the royalties the author earns.
    In practice the advance is frequently not “earned out”, so the author is taking
    a higher share of the total revenue from the book than the royalties would earn.
    Of course, every publisher knows that you can publish profitably even if the advance
    doesn’t earn out. It is better when it does because that both reduces the risk
    of failure—a big “unearned” spells certain loss—and improves the business’ cashflow
    because you pay royalties when a book sells, so you have money from that sale.
    Advances are paid upfront.

  zh: 让我们假设这些数字是可信的。出版社现在可以为这本书提供报价。Profile的报价总是针对预付款（以及版权收入，如果出版商拥有，比如翻译权）。理论上，出版商会根据作者赚取的版税来确定预付款的水平。实际上，预付款经常无法“赚回来”，因此作者从书籍的总收入中获得的份额比版税赚取的要高。当然，每个出版商都知道，即使预付款没有赚回来，也可以盈利出版。当预付款赚回来时，情况会更好，因为这既降低了失败的风险——大额“未赚回来”的预付款意味着确定的损失——又改善了企业的现金流，因为当书籍销售时，您会支付版税，因此您会从销售中获得收入。预付款是预先支付的。
- en: Advances can be anything from a few hundred pounds, though rarely less than
    £1,000 for a reputable trade house, up to a reported eight- figure sum for last
    year’s multi-book contract signed by Bonnier with Wilbur Smith. In theory, they
    are paid at a market price. But trade book royalties are almost invariably the
    same, with little real variation. As all authors know, the bog- standard hardback
    royalty is 10% of the r.r.p., often rising after specified sales thresholds to
    12.5% and 15%. Similarly, 7.5% is the standard paperback royalty, generally rising
    to 10%. But this is based on the r.r.p., not the money the publisher collects.
    Bookshops and wholesalers take more than half the r.r.p. now. Standard discounts
    are between 52% and 60%, and the biggest booksellers, naturally, get the biggest
    discounts. So an author on a 10% royalty for a £10 hardback is taking £1, or 10%
    of the total price. But if the publisher is selling the book at a 56% discount
    to bookshops, then the author will receive 23% of the publisher’s total net revenue.
    This is extraordinarily close to the 25% of net receipts that is now the gold
    standard for e-book royalties.

  zh: 进步可以是从几百英镑起，尽管对于一家声誉良好的贸易公司来说很少低于£1,000，一直到去年Bonnier与Wilbur Smith签订的多本书合同中报告的八位数金额。理论上，它们是按市场价格支付的。但贸易书籍的版税几乎总是相同的，变化很小。正如所有作者所知道的，标准精装书的版税是r.r.p.的10%，通常在指定的销售门槛后上升到12.5%和15%。同样，标准平装书的版税是7.5%，通常上升到10%。但这是基于r.r.p.，而不是出版商收取的金额。现在书店和批发商拿走了r.r.p.的一半以上。标准折扣在52%到60%之间，而最大的书店自然会获得最大的折扣。因此，对于一本£10的精装书，按照10%的版税，作者将获得£1，或者出版商总净收入的10%。但如果出版商以56%的折扣向书店销售书籍，那么作者将获得出版商总净收入的23%。这与现在电子书版税的净收入的25%非常接近。
- en: In export, where royalties are paid on net receipts, discounts can be even higher
    and publishers’ costs are greater because of the greater shipping and sales costs.
    So bookshops take more than half of the total and publishers give almost a quarter
    of their revenue to the author. In both 2016 and 2017, Profile paid out just over
    22% of its total revenues to its authors. But where does the rest go?

  zh: 在出口领域，版税是按净收入支付的，折扣甚至更高，出版商的成本更高，因为运输和销售成本更高。因此，书店拿走了总额的一半以上，出版商将近四分之一的收入给作者。在2016年和2017年，Profile向其作者支付了总收入的略高于22%。但剩下的钱去哪了呢？

- en: 'Publishing accountants, like all others, split costs into two, the direct costs
    of selling each book and the overheads. The overheads are easy to enumerate but
    hard to control: salaries, heating, lighting, computers and desks, rent, business
    rates and the other essentials of every business, whether selling books or cream
    cakes. They also include less obvious expenses such as staff training, libel insurance
    (most publishers cover their authors’ costs in the event of a claim) and computer
    software. These are fixed costs and they have a way of rising beyond publishers’
    control. Like all publishers, at Profile we aim to keep them down but salaries,
    like authors’ remuneration, are not generous in the book trade and costs continue
    to rise year on year.'

  zh: 出版会计师，像其他所有人一样，将成本分为两部分，销售每本书的直接成本和一般费用。一般费用很容易列举，但很难控制：工资、供暖、照明、计算机和桌子、租金、营业税以及每家企业的其他必需品，无论是销售书籍还是奶油蛋糕。它们还包括一些不那么明显的费用，如员工培训、诽谤保险（大多数出版商在发生索赔时为他们的作者支付费用）和计算机软件。这些是固定成本，它们有一种超出出版商控制的方式上升。像所有出版商一样，在Profile，我们的目标是将它们控制在较低水平，但是工资，就像作者的报酬一样，在书籍行业并不丰厚，成本继续年复一年地上升。
- en: Any author who has been to a Big Four (trade) publisher’s office will know they
    cut costs by cramming staff into huge open-plan offices that are not unlike old-fashioned
    factory production lines, no matter how elegant the space. Profile Books employs
    40 people and its office in Angel costs approximately £335,000 a year to rent.
    Business rates are on top, and are about to increase significantly. Fixed costs
    also include capital expenditure. All that has to be paid for from the net receipts
    of sales of books. Apart from some small share of income from the sale of rights,
    there is no other way for publishers to pay for these things in order to provide
    the services that they do. As our most recent (2017) accounts show, our salary
    bill last year was £2.6m. We pay out much more in advances and royalties than
    in salaries, and we are not a “Gradgrind” employer.

  zh: 任何去过四大（贸易）出版商办公室的作者都会知道，他们通过将员工塞进类似于老式工厂生产线的巨大开放式办公室来削减成本，无论空间多么优雅。Profile Books雇佣了40人，其位于Angel的办公室每年租金约为33.5万英镑。商业税额外增加，而且即将大幅增加。固定成本还包括资本支出。所有这些都必须从书籍销售的净收入中支付。除了从版权销售中获得的一小部分收入外，出版商没有其他方式来支付这些费用，以便提供他们所提供的服务。正如我们最近（2017年）的财务报表显示的那样，去年我们的薪资支出为260万英镑。我们在预付款和版税方面支付的金额比薪资支出要多得多，我们不是一个“格雷格兰德”雇主。
- en: These costs do not change whether we sell one book or one million. All publishers

- en: And then there are the direct costs attached to each book. These are the costs
    of sales. For publishers to sell their books they must have a sales force, which
    never comes cheap. It can mean international offices too, in the case of the largest
    companies. Profile is part of the Independent Alliance, for which Faber provides
    some, but not all, of the sales arrangements. This all costs up to 12.5% of the
    total net sales revenue depending on the type of sale, with international sales
    more expensive.

- en: The entire UK book trade operates on sale or return, with the supermarkets being
    the most “dangerous” customers. Profile’s total returns on UK sales are approximately
    14%, but that average hides some books with far worse rates. Sometimes more than
    40% or even 50%. Returns are a real cost, because the publisher has paid to print
    and deliver the books, and when the books come back they are generally pulped.

- en: Distribution (warehousing and physically shipping books around the world) is
    one of two costs attached to physical sales only. They do not apply to e-books,

    employs four full-time publicists and three full-time marketers who work on however
    many (or few) titles are published. But marketing costs—billboards, Tube and bus
    posters, digital and social media campaigns, and even author parties—are variable.
    Publishers tend to budget 6%–8% of expected net sales revenues for marketing.
    For the biggest titles each season that can run into tens of thousands of pounds,
    particularly if TV advertising is in the mix. In reality we have to decide on
    the campaign, buy the media slots and send the party invitations before we have
    any idea how many books we will sell. So this is a risky business—a difficult

- en: Finally there is the cost of goods sold (COGS), i.e. making the physical books.
    Printing and binding is relatively straightforward to calculate, and is generally
    between 8%–12% of the retail price. So 17%–25% of the net sales revenue; in other
    words, slightly less than the author share.

- en: Put another way, in 2016 and 2017, pre-press and printing costs were 24% of
    Profile’s total revenues—just a little under our advance and royalty payments
    to authors. Roughly, 4,000 copies of a B-format paperback of 256 pages will cost
    50p–75p per copy. A jacketed Royal-format hardback of 320 pages will cost £1.20–£1.60

- en: But there are also editorial and design costs. That 320-page hardback (let’s
    assume it’s non- fiction) will cost around £1,000 to copyedit and another £700
    to proofread. Then there is the page design (£750) and perhaps an index (£700).
    Finally, and of the greatest importance, the jacket or cover design. At Profile
    we budget £1,000– £1,500 for that and employ a full-time art director and designer
    (overheads) on top of that. Trade publishers are investing very heavily in how
