    anything else. I don't want any help. I hate some of these modern systems where
    you type up a lowercase letter and it becomes a capital. I don't want a capital,
    if I'd wanted a capital, I would have typed the capital.[George R.R. Martin](#rf1)

    use forever with no unneeded changes.

- en: Finished software is software that’s not expected to change, and that’s a feature!
    You can rely on it to do some real work.

- en: Once you get used to the software, once the software works for you, you don’t
    need to learn anything new; the interface will exactly be the same, and all your
    files will stay relevant. No migrations, no new payments, no new changes.
  prefs: []

- en: This kind of software can be created intentionally, with a compromise from the
    creators that they won’t bother you with things you don’t need, and only the absolutely
    necessary will change, like minor updates to make it compatible with new operating
    systems.

- en: Sometimes, finished software happens accidentally; maybe the company behind
    it has disappeared, or the product has been abandoned.

    commands like `cd`(to change the current directory) or `ls`(to list what’s there)
    won’t ever change in a significant way. You can rely on them until the end of
    your career.'

    daily lives.

- en: When we buy a physical product, we accept that it won’t change in its lifetime.
    We’ll use it until it wears off, and we replace it. We can rely on that product
    not evolving; the gas pedal in my car will always be in the same place.
  prefs: []

- en: However, when it comes to software, we usually have the ingrained expectations
    of perpetual updates. We believe that if software doesn’t evolve it’ll be boring,
    old and unusable. If we see an app with no updates in the last year, we think
    the creator might be dead.

- en: We also expect new versions of any software will be better than the previous
    ones. Once it’s released, most of our problems will be solved! What a deceiving
    lie.

- en: 'Sometimes, a software upgrade is a step backward: less usable, less stable,
    with new bugs. Even if it’s genuinely better, there’s the learning curve. You
    were efficient with the old version, but now your most used button is on the other
    side of the screen under a hidden menu.'

- en: In a world where constant change is the norm, finished software provides a breath
    of fresh air. It’s a reminder that reliability, consistency, and user satisfaction
    can coexist in the realm of software development.

    that sometimes, the best software is the one that doesn’t change at all.
