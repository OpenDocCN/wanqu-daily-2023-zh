    near Dolores Park in San Francisco, and at the end I was greeted with options
    such as ‚Äúblack sesame‚Äù and ‚Äúbalsamic strawberry.‚Äù Apparently this place was known
    for its unique flavors. The good news is that the balsamic strawberry ice cream
    was delicious. The bad news is that it planted an idea about competitive differentiation
    in my head that clouded my thinking for years.

    architecture, music, packaging, writing, and so on. But because I make software,
    I have a special place in my heart for clever apps. Unfortunately, though, they
    usually don‚Äôt make great businesses. The older I get, the more I appreciate the
    merits of vanilla software. There is money to be made in boring.

- en: Software that attempts to be different in a way that creates temporary excitement,
    but doesn‚Äôt create lasting value, is what I call ‚Äúflavored software.‚Äù Of course,
    no one *thinks* this is what they‚Äôre building. They think their unique twist is
    a revolution, and that everyone will adopt their innovation in the future. But
    sadly, more often than not, they‚Äôve invented the software equivalent of balsamic
    strawberry ice cream.

- en: The agonizing thing about balsamic strawberry is that it‚Äôs actually *good*.
    You show it to users and they‚Äôre like, ‚ÄúWow, tasty!‚Äù But because it‚Äôs software
    and not ice cream, it‚Äôs less obvious that it‚Äôs never going to beat vanilla. These
    apps can even grow substantially if the new flavor is good enough, but they often
    have trouble sustaining growth.

    apps, and to-do list apps. I have no disrespect for creators of products in these
    spaces, so I won‚Äôt reference specific names. But for each category, I'll talk
    about why I think products in it tend to hit early growth [asymptotes](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2018/5/21/invisible-asymptotes).
    Then I‚Äôll extract some general principles for distinguishing between mere flavor
    differentiation versus scalable value. As a bonus, I‚Äôll pick a few current ideas
    that seem huge but I predict are just the flavor of the month (sorry, AI avatar

    and instantly have a library full of all the content any user could want. As a
    result, developers have created a cornucopia of fun new ways of listening to podcasts.
    Some apps have custom playlists, others focus on discovery, and there are even
    some that have created custom audio engines to make the podcasts sound better.

    your favorite shows, can be enough to capture the hearts of tens of thousands

    the additional challenge of competing with enterprise project management systems.
    It‚Äôs nice to have a simple place to keep your personal tasks, but most of your
    work is probably flowing through a larger enterprise system like Notion, Asana,
    Jira, Linear, or a similar product. These are tough to compete with because they
    have network effects (you have to use what everyone else in your company uses),
    and unlike consumer apps, they do actually have switching costs (it‚Äôs much harder
    to move a group of people than to try something new for yourself).

    enterprise fads [like the metaverse,](https://every.to/napkin-math/the-meh-taverse?sid=13211)
    but generally speaking, large companies only sign contracts when it feels like
    there is an obvious commercial advantage to doing so.*   **Networks are (mostly)
    not flavor-based.** If you‚Äôre using an app because of the content created by its
    other users, it‚Äôs not necessarily a guarantee for success, but at least if it
    fails it probably won‚Äôt be because it hit a flavor-based asymptote. For instance,
    BeReal leveraged a unique flavor of photo sharing to build a network, but people
    are still using it because they like the way it helps them stay in touch with
    their friends. If it were just a single-player utility, it would not have scaled
    in the same way. Another historical example is Instagram versus [Hipstamatic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/10/how-instagram-beat-hipstamatic-its-own-game/322743/).
    Both had a cool new flavor called ‚Äúphoto filters,‚Äù but one had a network and the
    other did not. Here‚Äôs a more recent example: the network is what sets Substack
    stands apart from its flavor-based competition.*   **Tech-enabled services are
    not flavor-based.** If you act like a tech company but really do grocery delivery,
    banking, education, housing, healthcare, or any other real-world service, your
    competition is mostly not flavor-based because starting this type of business
    involves a lot of cost and complexity. (Also, some, like ride hailing and delivery,
    are networks.) The downside is that your cost structure is probably not as great
    as pure tech companies, but the upside is that you have less competition.*'
