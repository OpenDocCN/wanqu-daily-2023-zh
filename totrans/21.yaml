    investors will evaluate your company for indicators of product-market fit. Series
    A fundraising for an OSS company has important nuances because the primary indicator
    of product-market fit is adoption, not revenue. In the first phase of building
    an OSS company, prioritization should be given to adoption at the expense of monetization.
    Therefore, OSS companies do not reach the same revenue milestones as other companies
    by the time it comes to raise Series A. The good news is that top open-source
    investors understand this and don’t evaluate OSS companies based on revenue. Instead,
    they will look at a different set of metrics to determine project adoption and
    community engagement as indicators of product-market fit and how well-positioned
    you are to achieve repeatable sales with your commercial offering.

    Many users who star your project may never end up using it. Instead, these metrics
    represent “mindshare” among your target audience. We’ve also observed that these
    types of metrics for OSS projects can vary widely across different categories
    of projects.

    and 2022\. You’ll see that average, median, and top-quartile star counts vary
    between open-source developer tools, data/ML, and security projects. Growth rate
    also varies though it’s worth noting that top decile month-over-month star growth
    across all companies is above 12%, which we consider to be best-in-class.

    activity starts to wane. Therefore, tracking absolute counts is insufficient.
    It’s necessary to measure growth rates in these metrics — week-over-week and month-over-month
    — to determine if your OSS project is maintaining or capturing additional mindshare.

    among your target audience, what metrics can you use to assess meaningful adoption?
    To start, the size of your community is a far better reflection of the number
    of users who have adopted your OSS than the number of GitHub stars. The degree
    of activity of user engagement in your community Slack or Discord is incredibly
    important — having hundreds of members with very little activity is a telling
    sign that your project adoption is minimal.

    in the OSS occur. To measure your project velocity, evaluate metrics such as the
    number of active project contributors (those who have contributed commits within
    a given recent time period), the number of issues that have been filed, and the
    number of pull requests.

    aspects. For example, as we previously highlighted, it’s valuable to understand
    the organizations that your users belong to since lighthouse companies provide
    early credibility. “The right metrics depend on your market, your product, and
    how it works,” says Ev Kontsevoy, Co-founder and CEO of [Teleport](https://goteleport.com/).
    “Find the proxy metric that measures your market-share capture.”

    If you are an open-source founder, this starts with identifying Series A investors
    with a track record of working with open-source companies and who know how to
    evaluate whether your OSS project has achieved (or is well on its way) to product-market
    fit. **Open-source software gives these investors ways to gauge traction early
    in a startup’s journey, before the company is generating revenue. The same transparency
    that makes OSS projects easy to adopt also provides a window for investors to
    assess your progress to date.**

    must communicate a compelling narrative that highlights the strength of your team,
    the large market opportunity, and the goals for this financing. However, for slides
    that cover traction, Series A investors want to see specific information to evaluate
    whether your OSS project has reached product-market fit and if your company is
    ready to build a repeatable sales motion. Here’s what you can expect them to look
    for.

    but are unable to monetize because their users have low willingness to pay. For
    example, if your user base is primarily made up of hobbyist developers, investors
    may question the commercial potential of your company. Investors will look out
    for what these adopters are saying about your project — why they found it compelling,
    what features they like best, why everyone else needs to be using it. Expect that
    investors will conduct reference checks with users at lighthouse companies to
    ask them directly.

    best ones) will want to understand the details of how those users are implementing
    your OSS. **Is it being used in production? This increases the likelihood that
    users are getting high value out of it. Has it been integrated with existing tooling
    and/or workflows? This signals that your OSS has some level of stickiness and
    is being used regularly.** What are the use cases that everyone gets started with?
    This suggests there is strong repeatability for user onboarding.
