- en: One of the most valuable lessons I learned when entering venture capital was
    that I should always ask myself when evaluating a new investment whether I could
    envision an S-1 (the form that must be filed by companies when they go public
    prior to an IPO) for the company. Intrigued by what this meant at a more granular
    level, I began to explore the common traits of developer tool / cloud infra companies
    that go public. **Specifically, in this world of “bottoms-up” and self-serve,
    can devtool companies go all the way to Wall Street on such a sales motion?**
    Do I need to expect a company I am considering investing in to be able to close
    hundreds or thousands of $100k+ enterprise contracts or even $1M+ contracts in
    order to go public?

    Furthermore, these small number of enterprise customers typically account for
    sizable portions of a company’s overall revenue. This becomes even more prevalent
    if we examine the <$25k ARPU public companies at an individual level to see the
    impact those larger contracts had on the business’ abilities to go public:'

    we see….not that much correlation, implying that both low-volume/high ACV and
    high-volume/low ACV types of business require high sales and marketing spend typically.
    However, we do see some very high sales efficiency for some of the low ARPU ones
    like DigitalOcean, Atlassian, and Twilio, which demonstrate that even if these
    businesses still needed to add on enterprise sales eventually, they were able
    to do so in a very capital efficient manner.

    10000% no (if 100% wasn’t clear enough!). It’s one of the most effective forms
    of growing an early stage business in a capital efficient manner. However, in
    most cases, I do need to see the potential for there to be several hundred businesses
    paying $100k+ and in some cases the potential for even $1M+ contracts down the
    road. After all, we’ve seen just how much $$$ enterprises are willing to shell
    over and how much they can comprise a business’ total revenue!
