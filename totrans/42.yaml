    grant, and even more so when they hear the percentage that they take.

- en: For every $1 I budgeted for my research, I had to account for an **additional
    $0.53** that would go to the university. Universities have a pre-specified percentage
    for overhead (also called facilities and administrative (F&A) costs or indirect
    costs). Equipment and tuition are excluded from the overhead calculation. It supposedly
    covers things like having a building to work in, electricity, basic computer equipment,
    and support staff. It is split amongst the university, college, and department.
    These F&A rates seem to only ever go up...

    are often only guaranteed 9 months of salary despite working the entire year.

- en: It is typical to pay yourself 0.5 to 1 month of salary per grant. Specifically,
    my three NSF grants covered 0.55, 0.75, and 1.0 months of my salary for each year.
    I found it funny that my college factored in annual raises into the budget that
    were always far higher than I actually received.

    Most notably, the NSF restricts you to 2 months of salary from all of your active
    NSF grants at any given time. Even if you have other funding sources, you can't
    have more than 12 months of salary.

    You effectively pay for the cost of an adjunct to take your teaching load.

- en: The largest component of my grants was supporting a graduate student. They're
    the ones doing the bulk of the daily work. It includes their salary ($2200 a month),
    tuition ($15,000 a year), and benefits ($200 a month). Approximately **$233,000**
    of **$481,112** from my last grant was for a graduate student for 5 years.

- en: There are ways to stretch this further. For example, many of my graduate students
    also worked as teaching assistants during the school year which covered their
    tuition, benefits, and a portion of their salary, so I just had to pay the difference
    in salary. Though it did eat a nontrivial amount of their time and attention.
    Moreover, my graduate students often won fellowships/scholarships that boosted
    their salary to a more sustainable wage.

- en: In computer science, conferences are a vital way to network and share research.
    It is also often required once a paper has been accepted for publication, so I
    budget for one trip per year for both myself and a graduate student. I budgeted
    for alternating between domestic and international travel every other year. Something
    like $2300 for domestic per person and $3300 for international per person. It
    covers airfare, food, conference registration (silly expensive!), and hotel.

    The NSF makes it easy to add-on to grants for this later through "NSF REU Supplements".
    I hired many undergrads, though I always used my startup fund.

- en: What about **equipment**? Considering I work in software, all I or my students
    ever really needed were just typical computers so my equipment budget was $0\.
    The NSF expects such equipment to be covered by the F&A costs. It is common for
    researchers in other other fields to budget for expensive, specialized equipment
    though.

    a "no-cost extension" from the NSF that seems to be automatically approved (at
    least the first time) that gives you an additional year to wrap things up. I did
    this. You also have some wiggle room to move funds between the budgeted categories
    which I put unneeded stress on myself to not do.
