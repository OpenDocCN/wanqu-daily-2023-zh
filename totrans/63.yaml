    Can you look into this?"*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I looked. The old SDK, the one that got acquired, takes your tracking plan and
    generates a custom client-side library. This gives you TypeScript support for
    analytics events which is amazing. Highly recommend!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The generated client-side library uses a plugin system to send events directly
    to your analytics vendor.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But since that SDK got acquired, they wanted to change this. The new company
    thinks of itself as an analytics vendor and sees our old vendor as a direct competitor.
    They want to kill the direct integration üí©
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The new company wants to send events to itself *then* stream to other services,
    if it really has to. This created problems for our HIPAA compliance because we
    didn't have the right contract in place. Events cannot touch new company's servers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After looking at alternatives, we decided to consolidate on the new company.
    They offer tight integration between tracking plans, analytics, and a few other
    features.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All HIPAA compliant with the right contract and way easier for product teams
    to use. Sweet.
  prefs: []

    in demo after demo making sure this new vendor can do what we need, do it well,
    and isn't selling promises from the backlog.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Out of the 15 repositories we needed to migrate, 2 are owned by my team, and
    ~6 we could opportunistically help out because the changes were small. I had to

  prefs: []

    our old data?"* [all of it all at once] and they said *"yes of course you can
    migrate old data!"* [within your monthly data limits].
  prefs: []

    You tell product teams the deadline is March 24 so platform has time to migrate

    oldest data so you can find sharp edges early.
