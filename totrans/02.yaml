    As online shopping slows within China, a new generation of e-commerce companies
    has emerged, with their sights set on foreign customers. Their rise has been meteoric:
    In the past few years, Shein has cornered the fast-fashion market and is now expanding
    to sell almost anything; Temu only launched at the end of 2022 and now has 130
    million global users; and TikTok is converting its vast user base into online
    shoppers with TikTok Shop.'

    buyers and sellers. Their ultra-low prices have enticed customers and beaten back
    the competition but also invited scrutiny. Governments are starting to question
    the impact on local business and the integrity of supply chains — in some cases
    changing import rules or even banning platforms outright.

    to shake its reputation as just the manufacturer of cheap “made in China” goods,
    and show that it can build whole brands and business models that dominate the
    global stage. For this series, *Rest of World* spoke with Chinese factory owners,
    visited an automated package sorting center in Pakistan, went behind the scenes
    with an Indonesian shopping influencer, took a trip to a market full of Nigerian
    counterfeit merchants, and went on a Temu shopping spree to explore how this new
    era of e-commerce is changing the way we shop.
