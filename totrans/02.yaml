- en: 'China is no longer just the world’s factory; now, it’s also the world’s mall.
    As online shopping slows within China, a new generation of e-commerce companies
    has emerged, with their sights set on foreign customers. Their rise has been meteoric:
    In the past few years, Shein has cornered the fast-fashion market and is now expanding
    to sell almost anything; Temu only launched at the end of 2022 and now has 130
    million global users; and TikTok is converting its vast user base into online
    shoppers with TikTok Shop.'

  zh: 中国不再仅仅是世界的工厂；现在，它也是世界的商场。随着中国国内在线购物增长放缓，一批新一代电商公司崛起，将目光投向海外客户。它们的崛起势如破竹：在过去几年里，Shein
    已经垄断了快时尚市场，现在正在扩展销售几乎任何东西；Temu 仅在2022年底推出，现在拥有1.3亿全球用户；TikTok 正将其庞大的用户群转化为在线购物者，通过
    TikTok Shop。
- en: The rise of these Chinese shopping platforms has reshaped online shopping for
    buyers and sellers. Their ultra-low prices have enticed customers and beaten back
    the competition but also invited scrutiny. Governments are starting to question
    the impact on local business and the integrity of supply chains — in some cases
    changing import rules or even banning platforms outright.

  zh: 这些中国购物平台的崛起已经重塑了买家和卖家的在线购物方式。它们的超低价格吸引了客户并击败了竞争对手，但也引起了审查。各国政府开始质疑对本地企业和供应链完整性的影响
    - 在某些情况下改变进口规则甚至直接禁止平台。
- en: For now, though, the boom continues. The Chinese e-commerce sector is on a mission
    to shake its reputation as just the manufacturer of cheap “made in China” goods,
    and show that it can build whole brands and business models that dominate the
    global stage. For this series, *Rest of World* spoke with Chinese factory owners,
    visited an automated package sorting center in Pakistan, went behind the scenes
    with an Indonesian shopping influencer, took a trip to a market full of Nigerian
    counterfeit merchants, and went on a Temu shopping spree to explore how this new
    era of e-commerce is changing the way we shop.

  zh: 然而，目前繁荣仍在持续。中国电商行业正努力改变其仅仅是廉价“中国制造”商品制造商的声誉，展示其可以打造主导全球舞台的整个品牌和商业模式。为了这个系列，*Rest
    of World*与中国工厂老板进行了交谈，参观了巴基斯坦的自动包裹分拣中心，与印尼购物影响者幕后合作，前往一个充满尼日利亚假冒商人的市场，并进行了一次 Temu
    购物狂欢，探索这个电商新时代如何改变我们的购物方式。
