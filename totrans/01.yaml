    cryptographic technologies provide extra layers of privacy beyond the Signal app
    itself. Since launching in 2013, the Signal Protocol—our end-to-end encryption
    technology—has become the de facto standard for private communication, protecting
    the contents of billions of conversations in WhatsApp, Google Messages, and many
    others. Signal also continues to invest in research and development in the pursuit
    of extending communications privacy. This commitment underlies our recent work
    to add a layer of [quantum resistance](/blog/pqxdh/) to the Signal Protocol, and
    our previous work on [metadata protection technologies](/blog/sealed-sender/)
    that help keep personal details like your [contact list](/blog/building-faster-oram/),
    [group membership](/blog/signal-private-group-system/), [profile name](/blog/signal-profiles-beta/),
    and other intimate information secure. This singular focus on preserving the ability
    to communicate privately is one reason that we work in the open, documenting our
    thinking and [making our code open source](https://github.com/signalapp) and open
    to scrutiny—so you don’t have to take our word for it.

    a little privacy” in the name of hitting growth and monetary targets. This is
    important in an industry where “free” consumer tech is almost always underwritten

    higher bandwidth costs for Signal’s calling-related relay servers. At current

    voice and video calls is around 20 petabytes per year (that’s 20 million [gigabytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte))

    your profile name or chosen profile photo. This approach is unique in the industry.
    In fact, it has been [more than six years](/blog/signal-profiles-beta/) since
    we first announced this additional layer of protection, and as far as we know
    none of our competitors have yet adopted it. Other messengers can easily see your
    profile photo, profile name, and other sensitive information that Signal cannot
    access. Our choice here reflects our staunch commitment to privacy, but it also
    means that it took Signal more effort to implement support for profile photos.
