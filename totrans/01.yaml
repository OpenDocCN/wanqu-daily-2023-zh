- en: Signal is the world’s most widely used truly private messaging app, and our
    cryptographic technologies provide extra layers of privacy beyond the Signal app
    itself. Since launching in 2013, the Signal Protocol—our end-to-end encryption
    technology—has become the de facto standard for private communication, protecting
    the contents of billions of conversations in WhatsApp, Google Messages, and many
    others. Signal also continues to invest in research and development in the pursuit
    of extending communications privacy. This commitment underlies our recent work
    to add a layer of [quantum resistance](/blog/pqxdh/) to the Signal Protocol, and
    our previous work on [metadata protection technologies](/blog/sealed-sender/)
    that help keep personal details like your [contact list](/blog/building-faster-oram/),
    [group membership](/blog/signal-private-group-system/), [profile name](/blog/signal-profiles-beta/),
    and other intimate information secure. This singular focus on preserving the ability
    to communicate privately is one reason that we work in the open, documenting our
    thinking and [making our code open source](https://github.com/signalapp) and open
    to scrutiny—so you don’t have to take our word for it.

    ^(This provides an essential structural safeguard ensuring that we stay true to
    our privacy-focused mission. To put it bluntly, as a nonprofit we don’t have investors
    or profit-minded board members knocking during hard times, urging us to “sacrifice
    a little privacy” in the name of hitting growth and monetary targets. This is
    important in an industry where “free” consumer tech is almost always underwritten
    by monetizing surveillance and invading privacy. Such practices are often accompanied
    by “growth hacking” and engagement maximization techniques that leverage [dark
    patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern) to keep people glued to
    feeds and notifications. While Signal is also free to use, we reject this kind
    of manipulation, focusing instead on creating a straightforward interpersonal
    communications app. We also reject business models that incentivize such practices.)

    in a lane dominated by multi-billion-dollar corporations that have defined the
    norms and established the tech ecosystem, and whose business models directly contravene
    our privacy mission. So in order to provide a genuinely useful alternative, Signal
    spends tens of millions of dollars every year. **We estimate that by 2025, Signal
    will require approximately $50 million dollars a year to operate—*and this is
    very lean compared to other popular messaging apps that don’t respect your privacy***.

    money goes and how it’s made is a bit of a taboo in tech, something that most
    tech companies avoid talking about. The actual costs of consumer tech are generally
    hidden behind stories of innovation and the word “free,” and the connection between
    the product marketing of a highly profitable tech industry and the ingress and
    egress of profit and revenue is usually unclear. We believe a material map of
    these dynamics can help clarify just what is required to fulfill the dream of
    privacy-preserving alternative technology, and contribute to establishing a solid
    foundation from which we can grow alternatives that contest tech surveillance
    and the incentives behind it.

    encrypted. When you send a message, the Signal service *temporarily queues* that
    message for delivery. As soon as your message is delivered, that small bundle
    of encrypted data (i.e. your message) can be dropped from the queue. The storage
    of end-to-end encrypted files is temporary too, and any undelivered end-to-end
    encrypted data is automatically purged after a period of inactivity. Even though
    everything is only temporary, **this storage still costs Signal around $1.3 million
    dollars per year**.

    forever. But unlike the tech companies that collect and store everything, we don’t
    have (and do not want to have) any surveillance data to sell or use to recoup
    these costs. We can’t read or access any end-to-end encrypted messages because
    the keys that are required to decrypt them are in your hands, not ours. And it’s
    not just about your messages. Signal also uses our metadata encryption technology
    to protect intimate information about who is communicating with whom—we [don’t
    know who is sending you messages](/blog/sealed-sender/), and we [don’t have access
    to your address book](/blog/building-faster-oram/) or [profile information](/blog/signal-profiles-beta/).
    We believe that the inability to monetize encrypted data is one of the reasons
    that strong end-to-end encryption technology has not been widely deployed across
    the commercial tech industry.

    service for the many millions of people around the world who depend on Signal,
    it’s necessary for Signal’s servers to be globally distributed. Having a geographically
    distributed network of servers is particularly important for end-to-end encrypted
    voice and video calls, because latency can result in audio delays or degraded
    video connections that quickly make the app unusable for real-time communication.

    and others while ensuring that your messages and calls remain private and secure.
    We can’t access them, and neither can the companies that provide any of the infrastructure
    we rent. As a small nonprofit organization, we cannot afford to purchase all of
    the physical computers that are necessary to support everyone who relies on Signal
    while also placing them in independent data centers around the world. Only a select

    costs. To pick one example, we developed a new approach to private contact discovery
    in 2017 that uses a [trusted execution environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_execution_environment).
    This made us the first large-scale messaging app to let people automatically find
    their friends and contacts without revealing their address book to us, keeping
    these connections private. Because other mainstream apps don’t have this layer
    of privacy protection in place, they can often access details about your network
    and relationships without restrictions, and many of them store this highly sensitive
    information for later use.

    But as the number of people using Signal increased, the number of servers required
    to support private contact discovery also rose. At its peak, nearly 600 servers
    were dedicated to private contact discovery alone, at a total cost of **more than
    $2 million dollars per year**.

    research advances](https://signal.org/blog/building-faster-oram/) and hardware
    updates, we’ve been able to reduce the total number of private contact discovery
    servers to around 10 total—despite the fact that the service is handling more
    traffic than ever. A significant amount of money and engineering resources have
    been dedicated to ensuring that your address book remains completely inaccessible
    to us, and Signal will continue to push the envelope and introduce new techniques
    to enhance your privacy even when the initial costs are high.

    providers to optimize delivery across the globe, and the fees we pay to third-party
    vendors for every verification code we send can be very high. This is in part,
    we believe, because legacy telecom operators have realized that SMS messages are
    now used primarily for app registration and two-factor authentication in many
    places, as people switch to calling and texting services that rely on network
    data. In response to increased verification traffic from apps like Signal, and
    decreased SMS revenue from their own customers, these service providers have significantly
    raised their SMS rates in many locations, assuming (correctly) that tech companies
    will have to pay anyway.

    practice where some network operators split revenue with fraudulent actors to
    drive increased volumes of SMS and calling traffic on their network. The telephony
    providers that apps like Signal rely on to send verification codes during the
    registration process still charge their own customers for this make-believe traffic,
    which can increase registration costs in ways that are often unpredictable. Of
    course, Signal does everything we can to reduce or eliminate the impact of toll
    fraud. We work closely with our voice and SMS verification providers to detect
    and shut down fraudulent registrations as quickly as possible. But it’s still

    higher bandwidth costs for Signal’s calling-related relay servers. At current
    traffic levels, the amount of outbound bandwidth that is required to support Signal
    voice and video calls is around 20 petabytes per year (that’s 20 million [gigabytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte))
