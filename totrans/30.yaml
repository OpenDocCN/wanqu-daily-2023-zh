    different camps: the bootstrappers, the VC-backed tech-bros, the crypto “investors”,
    the people marketing their courses on marketing courses, the newsletter gurus,
    the micro-saas homeboys. The list goes on.'

    products. Some are moonshots, others are sustainable “grow-slowly” types, and
    each has its own subset of hard-core, flame-war inducing followers. Ah, the internet
    is a beautiful, terrible, magical, ghastly, colourful place.

    various subcultures. After working at a VC backed startup, I went the bootstrapped
    route (popularised by the IndieHackers movement) with my own product. It was an
    interesting ride, but was still rife with the Marketing Course Joes who just made
    $3000 last week with their “How to market no-code apps” course, as well as the
    Hustle Boys with their Twitter feeds full of “Work like no-one works today, so
    you can live like no-one lives tomorrow. #entrepreneur”. Neither of these resonated
    with me.'

    would spend hours nurturing her tomato plants, weeding, watering, puttering about.
    She would spend afternoons reading articles on permaculture, figuring out which
    plants grew well alongside other plants. Lavender with tomatoes kept the pests
    away, slight shade for the granadilla vine, some water, but not too much for the
    root vegetables. It was lovely to watch her coax tasty and nutritious food individually
    out of the ground. I can’t imagine full-scale farming being nearly as enjoyable.

    to the process, and have fun doing so. I want to make things that don’t scale.
    To see people tuck into them and enjoy them as people, not as stats. I’ve done
    this fairly successfully with [JustSketchMe](https://justsketch.me). We have a
    small, diverse, and amazing community of artists and illustrators making awesome
    things. I’m trying to build a similar product with [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev).
    Something niche but valuable. Something I can spend time on because I want to.

    Spending time meticulously improving subtle aspects of the product is enjoyable.

    This will differ depending on where you are. I live in Cape Town, South Africa
    where the cost of living is low (compared to the US and EU). I reached basic profitability,
    matching an average developer salary here, about 10 months ago, and since then
    I’ve been improving my projects. Not to grow at all cost, but to ensure that people
    using the tool have an ever-improving experience.
