- en: I want to draw attention to Bob Lee, a well-respected technologist and prototype
    hacker, always curious and sharing lots of interesting technical developments.
    He was a great role model for how Engineers should be respected in an executive
    capacity as he advanced his career from 'Software' to 'Product'. His efforts contributed
    to technology used by millions. What happened to him is tragic and wrong; he deserved
    better. Thank you, I'll miss you 'crazybob'.

    for his contributions rather than as a victim of this unfortunate awful event.
