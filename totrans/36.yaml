- en: About a year ago, Ben found out that one of his friends had quietly started
    to work multiple jobs at the same time. The idea had become popular during the
    COVID-19 pandemic, when working from home became normalized, making the scheme
    easier to pull off. A community of multi-job hustlers, in fact, had come together
    online, referring to themselves as the “overemployed.”

- en: The idea excited Ben, who lives in Toronto and asked that Motherboard not use
    his real name, but he didn’t think it was possible for someone like him to pull
    it off. He helps financial technology companies market new products; the job involves
    creating reports, storyboards, and presentations, all of which involve writing.
    There was “no way,” he said, that he could have done his job two times over on
    his own.

    intelligence chatbot developed by the research lab OpenAI. Soon enough, he was
    trying to figure out how to use it to do his job faster and more efficiently,
    and what had been a time-consuming job became much easier. ("Not a little bit
    more easy,” he said, “like, way easier.") That alone didn’t make him unique in
    the marketing world. Everyone he knew was using ChatGPT at work, he said. But
    he started to wonder whether he could pull off a second job. Then, this year,
    he took the plunge, a decision he attributes to his new favorite online robot
    toy.

    “ChatGPT does like 80 percent of my job if I’m being honest.” He even used it

- en: Over the last few months, the exploding popularity of ChatGPT and similar products
    has led to growing concerns about AI’s potential effects on the international
    job market—specifically, the percentage of jobs that could be automated away,
    replaced by a well-oiled army of chatbots. But for a small cohort of fast-thinking
    and occasionally devious go-getters, AI technology has turned into an opportunity
    not to be feared but exploited, with their employers apparently none the wiser.

    losing their jobs. For clarity, Motherboard in some cases assigned people aliases
    in order to differentiate them, though we verified each of their identities. Some,
    like Ben, were drawn into the overemployed community as a result of ChatGPT. Others
    who were already working multiple jobs have used recent advancements in AI to
    turbocharge their situation, like one Ohio-based technology worker who upped his
    number of jobs from two to four after he started to integrate ChatGPT into his
    work process. “I think five would probably just be overkill,” he said.

- en: Throughout the overemployed community, there is a quiet arms race to figure
    out just how much of the corporate workday can be automated away using an assortment
    of AI tools, some of which predate ChatGPT. The possibility of increasing their
    income, or at least easing the burden of holding down multiple jobs, has led to
    an explosion of experimentation.

    upcoming product release, he will explain the context and provide a template to
    ChatGPT, which then creates an outline for him and helps fill out the sections.
    The AI chatbot knows Ben’s title and the parameters of his duties and has become
    even better at understanding the context since the launch of GPT-4, the latest
    edition, he said. “I can just tell it to create a story,” said Ben, “and it just
    does it for me, based off the context that I gave it.” Ben still needs to verify
    the information—”sometimes it gets stuff wrong, which is totally normal,” he said—but
    the adjustments are relatively “minor” and easy to fix.

    his manager. In such cases, he requests that ChatGPT write the message in all
    lowercase, so that it appears more organic to the boss.  Another overemployed
    worker also told me they have started using ChatGPT to transcribe Zoom meetings
    so they can be largely ignored in the moment and referenced later.

- en: Charles, who has worked as a software engineer and product manager and solutions
    architect, including at a FAANG company, had been all-in on overemployment since
    2020—while he currently works two jobs, he worked four at the height of the pandemic—but
    said that AI tools have made juggling the positions much easier.

- en: At the FAANG company, he was able to outsource written tasks to AI tools, like
    writing a memo to defend and justify a business decision. In such a case, he’d
    input the relevant facts and parameters into an AI chatbot, which would cohesively
    lay them out more quickly than he ever could. Additionally, he’d use it to lay
    out directions for engineers (“It allows you to take, basically, a sentence and
    expand it out into a paragraph”); and create a “foundation” when coding. The ChatGPT-created
    code “oftentimes” would work perfectly, he said, but the errors could be identified
    and resolved easily enough, he said.

- en: One member of the overemployed, who, unusually, works three financial reporting
    jobs, said he’s found ChatGPT useful in the creation of [macros in Excel](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/quick-start-create-a-macro-741130ca-080d-49f5-9471-1e5fb3d581a8).
    “I can create macros, but it takes me an hour, two hours, plus, to write the code,
    test it, make sure everything's working,” he said. By comparison, with ChatGPT,
    he can provide the parameters and it’ll “spit something out” that he can update
    and tweak to his specifications. The process can allow him to cram what is traditionally
    a “two-week long process” into a few hours.  (He says he avoids providing ChatGPT
    with confidential information.)

    and another as a senior dev (one job is on Pacific time and one is in the United
    Kingdom), similarly said that ChatGPT’s code can leave something to be desired,
    but said it’s been useful when it comes to writing emails. “Most people in tech
    probably aren't as good at writing things as most other people,” Daniel said.
    He included himself in that critique of his own industry, but said it’s no longer
    a problem, as he can plug the key points into ChatGPT and ask the AI assistant
    to rewrite it “in a more professional way,” he said. “It's really good for stuff
    like that.”

    financial spheres of the overemployed community. Marshall, a university lecturer
    in the United Kingdom who secretly runs a digital marketing agency and tech startup
    on the side, has become a ChatGPT fanatic since its release. (During class, he
    often has students run through exercises, during which time he is often able to
    open up his laptop and work on his side hustles.) “It’s the best assistant ever,”
    he told me excitedly.

    “I'm quite a conceptualizing person. So I'm quite happy for my brain to do that.
    But the first draft of anything almost always goes through GPT,” he said.  Already,
    the chatbot has helped him generate business plans, internal system documents,
    blog posts, and Excel spreadsheets. He estimated that ChatGPT can often pull off
    80 percent of the legwork, leaving him to handle the final 20 percent.

    was “50-50 me and ChatGPT,” he said) and complete coursework for a master’s degree
    necessary to receive a university teaching qualification he was too busy to handle
    by himself while working three jobs.

    on by corporate leaders. But that doesn’t mean they think what they are doing
    is amoral. “I never could mentally comprehend why it was so taboo for me to work
    two salaried positions,” said the Ohio-based technology worker. “There's plenty
    of people I've known in my personal life who have worked at Walmart from 4 a.m.
    to 2 p.m., and then gone and worked another job.” The financial professional similarly
    said he started working multiple jobs because he doesn't trust that working as
    hard as he can at a single job will be “rewarded with more pay,” just “more work.”
    By taking on more jobs, he can do more work but also “get paid for it,” he said.

    considers himself part of the FIRE movement—short for “Financial Independence,
    Retire Early” Not yet 30, he is already making $500,000 working two jobs and worth
    around $3 million, claims he backed up to Motherboard with documentation. But
    he hopes to increase his compensation to $800,000 by tacking on a third position,
    and reach a net worth of $10 million by 35.

    is trying to figure out ways to make his dream even easier to obtain. When we
    spoke he said he’s already been “able to outsource” coding tasks to a third party
    in the past, and that he has been hard at work trying to develop a way to have
    someone else mimic both his voice and image on a computer screen. Once he can
    do so, he said, he hopes to offshore his job to someone in India who can “do my
    job for me.”

    taking advantage of a brief moment in time, when the tools that can be used to
    automate a job are much better understood by the workforce than the bosses with
    hiring and firing ability. One person, who works multiple jobs in information
    technology, spoke openly about the tension that created: People can more easily
    hold down multiple jobs today; but, should the bosses realize just how much their
    jobs can be handled by robots, they could be at risk of their jobs being automated
    away. As a result, he said, there’s good reason to keep quiet about what they’ve
    discovered.'

    in a large Midwestern city. Over the last year, he has watched in astonishment
    as ChatGPT figured out a way to automate an ever-growing percentage of his job,
    including writing ad copy and blog posts. The feat can feel exciting, and it has
    temporarily made his job easier.  “I can crank out a blog post in, you know, 45
    minutes now, as opposed to three hours. It's insane,” he said.
