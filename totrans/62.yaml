- en: I hated writing in high school. It wasn’t objective like my favorite subjects,
    math and science. It also didn’t help that we had to write about old, hard-to-understand
    literature like Shakespeare. But my perspective on writing changed once I started
    working full-time as a software engineer.

- en: The way I worked started to change around when I became a mid-level engineer.
    I led a small workstream of a few engineers and to get my work done, I was writing
    more and more without realizing it. Soon writing became a significant part of
    my work outside of coding. This became even more true when COVID hit since most
    conversations moved to async chats and word docs.

- en: Almost everything software engineers do requires writing. We need to write when
    we ask technical questions, comment on code reviews, or create design docs. This
    is because writing software is collaborative. **The better you are at writing,
    the more effective you will be at building software.**

- en: Aside from being a necessity, writing is the most efficient way for you to scale
    yourself. As a concrete example, I have a friend who takes incredible notes at
    work. His notes become a wiki of common terminal commands, code pointers, and
    diagrams for the team he works on. The best part is that his writing helps others
    move faster without any work on his part after sharing it.

    much more impact by influencing others to ship what matters most. **Writing is
    the most scalable way to influence others.**

    us, I still think writing is valuable.

    your writing gives you a deeper understanding. This process improves your thinking.

    of them**. When I write design docs, I often discover optimizations or edge cases
    I didn’t think of at first. So long as critical thinking is necessary, writing
    will not be obsolete.'

    technical writers**. It is one of the key skills engineers need to be effective
    at work. This is one of the main reasons I’ve committed to writing once a week
    for this Substack.'
