    of the world decades earlier, and stayed on in rent-stabilized rooms as the hotel

    for more than 40 years, yet remain a mystery even to those who saw her daily.
    That anonymity would follow her in death.

    the '70s. She was well liked among the hotel staff. They recall how she would
    walk through the lobby on Friday mornings with a shopping cart, saying hello to
    everyone with a huge smile. She responded to simple acts of kindness with thank
    you letters.

    card the next day on your desk," recalled Ali Mahmood, who works for the hotel''s
    owners. "Someone took 45 minutes to make that card."'

    to knowing her.

    knows my name," Querijero said. "[But she] doesn''t say so much, you know, except
    the usual greetings, ''How are you? Weather is nice. I''m gonna get my mail.''"
    Querijero often played piano in the evenings after work and Hasegawa could hear
    the music carrying through the walls. She would stop Querijero in the hallway
    to thank her for playing, saying how nice it was to hear it.'

    with Hasegawa and understood the way of life there.

    same size as Hasegawa's — one big space serving as both living room and bedroom,
    with a private bathroom and a tiny kitchen nook the size of a closet. There were
    few appliances, but there was a hot plate and a hotel-sized refrigerator.

    decades, I can''t stand this apartment."'

    could live in New York City. Many hotels offered accommodations consisting of
    a single bed in a cubicle, or a private room with a shared kitchen and bathroom.

    — single room occupancy. But by the 1970s, they had gained a reputation as hotbeds
    for criminal activity and the city began to shut them down. Today, advocates argue
    that SROs are not the problem, but a possible solution to providing affordable
    housing in an increasingly unaffordable city.

    the investigators started asking questions about Hasegawa's family and friends.
    Querijero realized that after all these years of living across the hall, she had
    never seen Hasegawa with anyone — a thought that still troubles her.
