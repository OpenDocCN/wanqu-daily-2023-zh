- en: Hasegawa was born in Japan in 1934 and it's believed she came to New York in
    the '70s. She was well liked among the hotel staff. They recall how she would
    walk through the lobby on Friday mornings with a shopping cart, saying hello to
    everyone with a huge smile. She responded to simple acts of kindness with thank
    you letters.

  zh: 长泽久子1934年出生于日本，据信她在70年代来到纽约。她在酒店工作人员中很受欢迎。他们回忆起她每个星期五早上推着购物车穿过大堂，对每个人微笑问好。她会对简单的善举回复感谢信。
- en: '"If you wrote her a rent receipt, for example, you would magically find a hand-drawn
    card the next day on your desk," recalled Ali Mahmood, who works for the hotel''s
    owners. "Someone took 45 minutes to make that card."'

- en: '"As far as the nearest neighbor, I''m the only one who she talks to and she
    knows my name," Querijero said. "[But she] doesn''t say so much, you know, except
    the usual greetings, ''How are you? Weather is nice. I''m gonna get my mail.''"
    Querijero often played piano in the evenings after work and Hasegawa could hear
    the music carrying through the walls. She would stop Querijero in the hallway
    to thank her for playing, saying how nice it was to hear it.'

  zh: “就最近的邻居而言，我是唯一一个她和我说话并知道我的名字的人，”Querijero说。“但她并不说很多，你知道，除了通常的问候，‘你好吗？天气很好。我要去拿我的邮件。’”Querijero经常在下班后的晚上弹钢琴，长泽久子能听到音乐从墙壁传来。她会在走廊上停下Querijero，感谢她的演奏，说听到很好听。

- en: Boyce came to the Belvedere in the early 1980s and moved into an apartment the
    same size as Hasegawa's — one big space serving as both living room and bedroom,
    with a private bathroom and a tiny kitchen nook the size of a closet. There were
    few appliances, but there was a hot plate and a hotel-sized refrigerator.

  zh: Boyce在80年代初来到贝尔维德，并搬进了一个和长泽久子一样大小的公寓——一个大空间既是客厅又是卧室，带有私人浴室和一个像壁橱一样大小的小厨房角。设备很少，但有一个热板和一个酒店大小的冰箱。

    in a hotel, in the heart of the city.'' It''s a big deal for them," she said.

- en: In the mid-20th century there were close to 200,000 units designated as SROs
    — single room occupancy. But by the 1970s, they had gained a reputation as hotbeds
    for criminal activity and the city began to shut them down. Today, advocates argue
    that SROs are not the problem, but a possible solution to providing affordable
    housing in an increasingly unaffordable city.

  zh: 20世纪中叶，有近20万个单位被指定为SRO（单间出租）。但到了20世纪70年代，它们已经被视为犯罪活动的温床，城市开始关闭它们。如今，倡导者认为SRO并不是问题，而是在一个日益昂贵的城市提供经济实惠住房的可能解决方案。
