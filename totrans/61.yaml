    from traditional SMBs and tech startups? And, why now?

- en: I see 3 relevant archetypes — (1) the traditional small business (2) the traditional
    Silicon Valley startup, and (3) the *Silicon Valley small business*. While they
    have similarities, they’re defined by the differences across their business objective,
    team, strategy, financing model, and endgame (or exit strategy).

- en: When we think of a traditional *small business*, it’s often a local mom-and-pop
    shop or trade professional (e.g. carpenter, photographer) as a sole proprietor.
    They offer a known product or service to a localized market. Small business “owners”
    might lack formal business knowledge but they know their customers and niche operation.
    The company stays small, hiring modestly just to meet demand.

- en: These small businesses are capital constrained and yet may avoid outside capital,
    fearing dependence or debt. On top of this, they often operate relatively capital-intensive
    businesses (whether materials, labor, or otherwise). And with low margins and
    scarce working capital, any volatility is a risk. At the same time, they’re in
    it for the long run; they’re not thinking about an exit. Financially, they count
    hundreds, think in thousands, and dream about millions.

- en: Silicon Valley startups are famous for their “founders,” the visionary early
    leaders. They bring new tech or tech-enabled products and services to market,
    serving a niche customer first, then expanding to a large, distributed base. It’s
    common for teams to be technically-skilled and experienced with startups and big
    tech. Teams expand to support the existing business but also to unlock and spur
    new growth.

    top tier institutional VC, build a team, run at it for years, and hope for a huge
    exit (and get some status and stability while doing it). The model SV startup
    seeks capital and aspires to build a high-growth, highly capital-efficient business
    with it. Success isn’t a lock until there’s a big exit — for founders, investors,
    and employees.

    *small business values and discipline* with *big tech know-how and ambition.*

- en: '**Founding teams may** ***look*** **like that of a “traditional” Silicon Valley
    startup.** They’re native to Silicon Valley ethos, skills, and playbooks. *But*,
    beneath the surface, they’re different. You might see more solopreneurs and studios
    (and LLCs instead of C-corps). They value autonomy and flexibility. They envision
    a range of potentially good outcomes — not binary, all-or-nothing scenarios.'

    Valley small business* as having 20 or fewer employees (and often less than 10).
    In my experience, startup teams above this size are forced to operate very differently
    — much slower, with more bureaucracy, and less alignment. But below the threshold,
    a savvy team can create leverage and punch above its size.'

- en: '**They’re growth-oriented and going for efficient scale.** Unlike small businesses
    (and contrary to the common characterization of teams that bootstrap), SV-SBs
    aren’t just trying to build “lifestyle” businesses or modest passive income streams.
    They *want* to scale, as quickly and efficiently as possible. The desire and often
    the know-how to scale separates them from traditional small businesses, and their
    focus on doing it leaner and profitably can separate them from the traditional
    SV startup.'

- en: '**They try to bootstrap to profitability instead of relying on venture capital.**
    They’re VC-literate yet aren’t charmed by the potential status, signal, or stability.
    Perhaps they raise the equivalent of a friends & family or pre-seed round but
    not much more. They look for capital-efficient businesses and prioritize profit
    alongside growth early on. With less money going in, there’s a lower bar for financial
    return. Moreover, “success” doesn’t require a billion dollar exit. Making millions
    is a win (and thousands keeps the team afloat).'

    choices, and not mere symptoms of a fleeting stage.** Otherwise, it’s easy to
    look at every early-stage tech startup as a “Silicon Valley small business.”'
