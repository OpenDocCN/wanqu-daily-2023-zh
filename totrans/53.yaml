    into [MuleSoft](https://www.mulesoft.com/), the software integration platform
    to connect any app or data source using APIs. An overwhelming majority of software
    today is built using APIs.

- en: But the next, exciting phase of the API economy, specifically third-party APIs,
    is just beginning in 2020\. With the rise of serverless applications, backend
    functionalities are increasingly behind APIs, rather than on web servers. With
    an accelerated transition to cloud computing, APIs are playing a more crucial
    role integrating and facilitating cloud migration. App development is cheaper
    than ever before, and JAMstack is reliant upon APIs to shield complexity from
    web architecture. Not to mention third-party APIs are easier to flexibly use and
    integrate with query languages like GraphQL, and network effects compound a given
    API’s value over time.

- en: This convergence of factors creates a ripe environment for APIs to flourish
    — and those companies that provide APIs that deliver value for frequent, universal
    cases will dominate. Users discern and switch APIs until they find the one that
    best fits their needs — fostering a competitive market driving innovation forward.

- en: What’s an API? [Justin Gage’s breakdown](https://technically.substack.com/p/whats-an-api)
    is one of the clearest I’ve seen. At a basic level, an API takes a specific input
    and provides an output. An API can be internal within an existing company or app’s
    software stack, external or public APIs or functional code interfaces. Most often,
    APIs serve a specific use case and are often paired with a front-end dashboard
    tracking key metrics and analytics.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While you might not think of them this way, some of the biggest companies of
    the past few decades originated from easily-implemented APIs that gave their users
    heightened power, efficiency or accessibility. API-first companies like Stripe,
    Twilio & Okta either created new markets or dramatically grew existing categories.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yet as more and more APIs enter the landscape (several of which are doing seemingly
    the same function) how do you identify which one pulls away? How do translate
    these superpowers into concrete terms — what are the defining attributes of successful
    third-party API companies?

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Simplifies Complexity** → API takes away complexity, and makes a previous
    function easier than it was before, with a clear ROI in terms of either time or
    money. The best third-party APIs champion their users and a consumer often doesn’t
    even know it’s there (e.g. Stripe on e-commerce sites or Twilio messaging within
    apps.)'

    may not be a business’ core competency, it should be critical to the business’
    success, often tied in to a customer monetization or engagement loop (e.g. bank

    them so meaningfully that they organically spread the product across peer groups.'

    the content management space — pioneered by Automattic/Wordpress enabling easy
    blog and website creation or location data with Foursquare. Several more massive
    companies have also been built assembling a unique collection of API services
    together, such as Uber in the transportation space (APIs for maps, messaging,
    payments), or AWS in the computing space (APIs for a variety of web services,
    across frameworks and languages.)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A key distinction — many successful companies like Stripe or Twilio were API-first
    from inception, while others start with a non-API use case (e.g. Shopify with
    e-commerce back-end) but expand into APIs over time. The opposite is also true
    — API-first companies are strategically positioned to expand customer usage in
    other non-API products (e.g. Stripe Atlas, Shopify fulfillment, Okta lifecycle
    management.) Another interesting area of analysis is how companies broach the
    API to non-API product transition and the common attributes and strategies of
    those companies that successfully do so.
