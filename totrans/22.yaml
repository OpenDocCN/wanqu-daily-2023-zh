  zh: 当你的账单超过每年$2-3M时，开始考虑自建而非购买可能会变得诱人。这个决定的经济学问题在于供应商在原始基础设施之上收取了多高的利润率？对于Coinbase来说，一个好奇的问题是：当谈论可以证明需要一个团队的巨额成本时，他们是否考虑过自建？
- en: In the case of Coinbase, building in-house following a $65M bill was a clear
    no-brainer. They could hire a team of 10 senior and staff-level engineers in the
    Bay Area, and still have this team cost less than $5M/year. And they then only
    need to budget for the infra costs, which they can presumably bring down to low
    double digits per year.

  zh: 对于Coinbase来说，在支付了6500万美元账单后自建是一个明显的明智选择。他们可以在旧金山湾区雇佣一支由10名高级和员工级工程师组成的团队，而这支团队的成本仍然低于每年500万美元。然后他们只需要为基础设施成本预算，他们可以将其预计降低到每年两位数。
