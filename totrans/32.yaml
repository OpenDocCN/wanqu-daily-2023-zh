- en: One of the truths of software development is that users will *always* find a
    way to break your software. No matter how much thought you put in, how much user
    testing was done or how expertly designed your interface is. Users will break
    and misuse it. It is easy to lock yourself up in an Ivory Tower and ignore all
    complaints by users that are not perfectly tech-savvy. But that’s not actually
    the reality. And it’s certainly not the reality that you should be designing for.

  zh: 软件开发的一个真理是，用户*总是*会找到一种方法来破坏你的软件。无论你投入多少思考，做了多少用户测试，或者你的界面设计得多么精巧。用户会破坏和误用它。很容易把自己关在象牙塔里，忽略那些不完全精通技术的用户的所有投诉。但这实际上并不是现实。你设计的现实也绝对不应该是这样。
- en: Teaching gave me an idea of how small details, which I would not even notice,
    can make users fail. For example, in my course about WordPress, I often created
    some screenshot-guided tasks that my students were supposed to complete. However,
    since creating those was tedious (and I admittedly rushed creating them more often
    than not), I sometimes forgot to include steps like “click on the button”. Also,
    the students rarely voiced their confusion and instead spent a lot of time trying
    to figure it out on their own. But with their limited tech knowledge, this would
    only lead to frustration and eventually to giving up.

  zh: 教学让我意识到，我甚至不会注意到的小细节可能会导致用户失败。例如，在我关于WordPress的课程中，我经常创建一些以截图为指导的任务，我的学生应该完成。然而，由于创建这些任务很繁琐（而且我承认我经常匆忙创建它们），我有时会忘记包括“点击按钮”之类的步骤。此外，学生们很少表达困惑，而是花费大量时间试图自己解决问题。但由于他们有限的技术知识，这只会导致沮丧，最终放弃。
- en: The students were not even *average users* per se. They decided to sign up for
    the course, they were willing to sacrifice their free time to learn something
    new, and they paid for it — even though such courses are fairly cheap here. So
    their motivation during the course was higher than what you might expect from
    a typical user. This means that if even they get frustrated by unclear user interfaces,
    you can be sure that your average user will be even more irritated.

  zh: 学生们甚至不是*普通用户*。他们决定报名参加课程，愿意牺牲自己的空闲时间学习新东西，并为此付费 — 尽管这里的课程相当便宜。因此，他们在课程期间的动力比你对典型用户的期望更高。这意味着即使他们对不清晰的用户界面感到沮丧，你可以肯定你的普通用户会更加恼火。
- en: From a teaching perspective, this taught me that instructions should be *very*
    detailed. More detailed than you think they should reasonably be. I also introduced
    more frequent checkpoints, I actively asked my students if they have some troubles,
    and I made sure to always have a backup plan in case they got stuck.

- en: The only people I normally talk about tech with are programmers or at least
    techies at heart. So I often fall into the trap of over-relying on technical terms,
    jargon and acronyms. Especially since English is not my native language, I end
    up communicating in a weird mix between English terms and — in my case — German
    prose. My excuse has always been that using such terms helps me to be less verbose
    and more precise. But that’s not true. It’s just a **lazy way of communicating**.

  zh: 我通常只与程序员或至少是技术爱好者交谈。因此，我经常陷入过度依赖技术术语、行话和缩写的陷阱。特别是因为英语不是我的母语，我最终以一种奇怪的混合语言——在我这种情况下是德语散文——进行交流。我一直的借口是使用这些术语可以帮助我更简洁、更准确。但这是不正确的。这只是一种**懒惰的沟通方式**。
- en: Don’t get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with being lazy while communicating.
    Not every chat you have with coworkers needs to be a deeply insightful and well-crafted
    conversation. The goal is to first and foremost get your point across. But when
    you are teaching, you need to be concise and clear. You need to be able to explain
    complex concepts in a way that is easy to understand *without* using some specific
    terms. And especially when students ask questions about some feature’s background,
    that’s not easy.

  zh: 不要误会，在沟通时懒惰并没有错。你与同事的每次聊天都不需要是深刻见解和精心制作的对话。首要目标是首先让对方理解你的观点。但是当你在教学时，你需要简明扼要、清晰明了。你需要能够以易于理解的方式解释复杂概念，*而不*使用某些特定术语。尤其是当学生询问某个功能背后的问题时，这并不容易。
- en: For example, many questions about more advanced features of the WordPress block
    editor required knowledge about HTML. I suggest you to **not** fall into the trap
    of saying “Sorry, the answer requires too much background knowledge and is out-of-scope”.
    Instead, try to give some idea about the why and how. There is actually a lot
    to learn from those “X explained in 3 minutes” videos. Many of them do a great
    job at compressing complex topics into a condensed video. And this brevity is
    really needed to not lose your students in the midst of a lengthy explanation.

  zh: 例如，关于WordPress区块编辑器更高级功能的许多问题需要了解HTML知识。我建议你**不要**陷入这样的陷阱说“抱歉，答案需要太多背景知识，超出范围”。相反，尝试给出一些关于为什么和如何的想法。实际上，从那些“3分钟解释X”视频中可以学到很多东西。许多视频将复杂的主题压缩成简短的视频，做得非常出色。这种简洁确实很有必要，以免在冗长的解释中迷失学生。

    with and pay attention to how they explain things, but also to where corners were
    cut and where not.

  zh: 我从未想过要当老师，光是这个想法就让我感到可怕。然而，在一个随意的星期天早晨，我偶然看到了本地社区学院招聘教学职位的广告。我最大的动力是金钱。作为一名学生，额外的钱总是需要的。而且我最初以为这是一份相当轻松的工作，但幸运的是我被证明是错的。
- en: One of my mistakes was consistently **underestimating the time** needed for
    any task. The administration asked me to draw up an initial plan for the course
    so that they could schedule and advertise it. For a course about the basics of
    HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I deemed 4 lessons with about 2 hours each to be sufficient.
    Because of that, the course ended up being extremely fast-paced and reliant on
    homework. When presenting ideas and concepts, I quickly realized that I needed
    to slow down and explain things in more detail. And besides that, students (thankfully)
    had a lot of questions. So answering them also took a good chunk of time.

  zh: 我的一个错误是一直**低估所需时间**。管理部门要求我起草课程的初步计划，以便他们能够安排和宣传。对于一个关于HTML、CSS和JavaScript基础的课程，我认为4节课，每节约2小时，足够了。因此，课程最终变得非常快节奏，依赖于家庭作业。在呈现想法和概念时，我很快意识到我需要放慢速度，更详细地解释事物。而且，学生们（幸运地）有很多问题。因此回答这些问题也占用了大量时间。
- en: 'In my other course, the first lesson was basically spent to set up all the
    student’s local environments. For WordPress, I decided to use [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/de/index.html)
    with some pre-bundled WordPress installation. My naïve assumption was that this
    would work out smoothly, but the issues were endless: work computers without the
    privilege to install software, Mac users (for which I wasn’t prepared), students
    that had issues just sharing their screen with me, etc.'

- en: Surprisingly, explaining many of the technical concepts worked out quite well.
    I made heavy use of metaphors, similes and used popular and widespread websites
