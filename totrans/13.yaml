    to move to NYC and settle into my new apartment, and just as I was about to publish
    it, Elon rate-limited Twitter and so, sensing a moment of weakness, Meta pulled
    up its launch date for Threads to yesterday. This piece doesn’t cover Threads
    directly, nor does it talk about the rate-limiting fiasco. It’s focused on why
    I think Twitter got so much worse over the past year. I thought about holding
    off and reworking it entirely to incorporate all that happened this week, but
    in the end I decided that it was cleaner to publish this one as is. If Twitter
    hadn’t botched so much over this past year, Threads wouldn’t matter. Still, like
    past pieces I’ve written on topics related to Twitter, you can apply a lot of
    the ideas in this piece to analyzing Threads’ prospects. And I’ll push a follow-up
    piece with my specific reactions to and predictions for Threads soon-ish. [Follow

    always been a sort of approximation, a hack. You follow some people in an app,
    and it serves you some subset of the content from those people under the assumption
    that you’ll find much of what they post of interest to you. It worked in college
    for Facebook because a bunch of hormonal college students are really interested
    in each other. It worked in Twitter, eventually, though it took a while. Twitter''s
    unidirectional follow graph allowed people to pick and choose who to follow with
    more flexibility than Facebook''s initial bi-directional friend model, but Twitter
    didn''t provide enough feedback mechanisms early on to help train its users on
    what to tweet. The early days were filled with a lot of status updates of the
    variety people cite when criticizing social media: "nobody cares what you ate
