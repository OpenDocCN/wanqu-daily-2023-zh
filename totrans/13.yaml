    to move to NYC and settle into my new apartment, and just as I was about to publish
    it, Elon rate-limited Twitter and so, sensing a moment of weakness, Meta pulled
    up its launch date for Threads to yesterday. This piece doesn’t cover Threads
    directly, nor does it talk about the rate-limiting fiasco. It’s focused on why
    I think Twitter got so much worse over the past year. I thought about holding
    off and reworking it entirely to incorporate all that happened this week, but
    in the end I decided that it was cleaner to publish this one as is. If Twitter
    hadn’t botched so much over this past year, Threads wouldn’t matter. Still, like
    past pieces I’ve written on topics related to Twitter, you can apply a lot of
    the ideas in this piece to analyzing Threads’ prospects. And I’ll push a follow-up
    piece with my specific reactions to and predictions for Threads soon-ish. [Follow

    never seemed to understand why it worked for some people or what it wanted to
    be, and how those two were related, if at all. But in a twist of fate that is
    often more of a factor in finding product-market fit than most like to admit,
    Twitter's indecisiveness protected it from itself. Social alchemy at some scale
    can be a mysterious thing. When you’re uncertain which knot is securing your body
    to the face of a mountain, it’s best not to start undoing any of them willy-nilly.

    networks are largely ad-subsidized and where they’re almost all built around a
    singular dominant architecture of an infinite scrolling feed optimized for serving
    ads on a mobile phone. The path each network took to product-market fit selected
    for a specific user base. As with any community, but especially ones forced to
    cluster in close proximity in a singular feed, as is common in the West, the people
    making up the community go a long way towards determining its tenor and values.
    Its vibes. The composition of its users then determines how conducive that network
    is to what types of advertising and at what scale. Finally, closing the circle

    money gets the final word.

    like an underachieving mess before, but its structure, built up piece by piece
    by users following, unfollowing, liking, muting, and blocking over years and years
    in a continuous dialogue with the feed algorithm? That structure had a deceptive
    but delicate stability. Twitter and its users had assembled a complex but functional

    can forget how you had to put a period before a username if it opened a tweet
    so that the network wouldn’t treat it as a reply and hide it in the timeline).
