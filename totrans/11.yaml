    architecture is the perfect way to pretend that the code you wrote last month
    no longer exists! Now that it has been stuffed into a container and tucked behind
    a load balancer it's a *service* and we can forget all about it until it breaks,
    then we deprecate it as *legacy* and replace it with something new. Rolling green
    fields forever!

    implementation, or the test suite, but most engineers prefer to go to the place
    that everyone congregates to talk about - but not look at - code. Stack Overflow
    is a great resource for finding the code needed to solve your problem without
    having to look at a lot of code yourself!

    the time to take a proper look at code written by someone else. You had work to
    do!

    of tooling emerge that can actually write code by itself, turning 10x engineers
    into 1,000x engineers*!

    engineers understand that unnecessary code should be eliminated at all costs,

    be found in creating an elegant solution to a complex problem. The joy of creation

    and that every line of code they write comes at a cost.
