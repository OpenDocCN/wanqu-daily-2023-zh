    architecture is the perfect way to pretend that the code you wrote last month
    no longer exists! Now that it has been stuffed into a container and tucked behind
    a load balancer it's a *service* and we can forget all about it until it breaks,
    then we deprecate it as *legacy* and replace it with something new. Rolling green
    fields forever!

- en: Got a question about how one of your dependencies works? You could look at its
    implementation, or the test suite, but most engineers prefer to go to the place
    that everyone congregates to talk about - but not look at - code. Stack Overflow
    is a great resource for finding the code needed to solve your problem without
    having to look at a lot of code yourself!
