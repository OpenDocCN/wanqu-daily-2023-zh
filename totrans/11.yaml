    architecture is the perfect way to pretend that the code you wrote last month
    no longer exists! Now that it has been stuffed into a container and tucked behind
    a load balancer it's a *service* and we can forget all about it until it breaks,
    then we deprecate it as *legacy* and replace it with something new. Rolling green
    fields forever!

    implementation, or the test suite, but most engineers prefer to go to the place
    that everyone congregates to talk about - but not look at - code. Stack Overflow
    is a great resource for finding the code needed to solve your problem without
    having to look at a lot of code yourself!

    the time to take a proper look at code written by someone else. You had work to
    do!

    into 1,000x engineers*!

    The rolling green fields of their youth are a happy delusion, distracting from
    the cold, hard truth that all code demands maintenance. They have felt the pain

    engineers understand that unnecessary code should be eliminated at all costs,
    and all new code must prove its worth before being allowed to live. This is part
    of what drives them to pore over other peoples' code and provide meticulous review.

    be found in creating an elegant solution to a complex problem. The joy of creation
    hasn't diminished, but it has been tempered by an understanding that less is more,
    and that every line of code they write comes at a cost.
