- en: Over the past few months, I’ve had an [existential crisis](https://minimaxir.com/2023/10/ai-sturgeons-law/)
    about [my work](https://github.com/minimaxir) in open source AI on [GitHub](https://github.com),
    particularly as there has been both increasingly toxic backlash against AI and
    because the AI industry has been evolving so rapidly that I flat-out don’t have
    enough bandwidth to keep up. I took a break from working on my projects during
    that time, which *should* have been fine. One of my latest open source projects
    is [simpleaichat](https://github.com/minimaxir/simpleaichat), a Python package
    with 3k GitHub Stars for interfacing with [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com),
    and it was explicitly designed with limited scope and minimal dependencies so
    that I could take a break from development without my code&mldr;breaking.

- en: After I was in a good place mentally to resume my open source work, I glanced
    at the GitHub Issues for simpleaichat and someone filed a issue simply titled
    “has this been abandoned?” with another GitHub user following up with “With all
    due respect, I am also interested in the answer.”

    and there weren’t any.

- en: I’ve never seen any discussions or articles about whether it’s appropriate to
    ask if an open source repository is dead. Is there an implicit contract to actively
    maintain any open source software you publish? Are you obligated to provide free
    support if you hit a certain star amount on GitHub or ask for funding through
    GitHub Sponsorships/Patreon? After all, most permissive open source code licenses
    like the [MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) contain some
    variant of “the software is provided ‘as is’, without warranty of any kind.”

- en: simpleaichat regretfully isn’t my first open source project with complaints
    like this. The [Big List of Naughty Strings](https://github.com/minimaxir/big-list-of-naughty-strings)
    to track adversarial user-input text strings, which I pushed to GitHub about a
    decade ago, is essentially just a `txt` [file](https://github.com/minimaxir/big-list-of-naughty-strings/blob/master/blns.txt)
    with 45k GitHub Stars. There will never be dependency issues, and additions to
    the list that don’t target a distinct string issue may clutter the list more than
    it already is so I’m hesitant to accept every pull request. But despite that,
    people are angry.

    which like [inbox-zero](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/inbox-zero)
    is infeasible in practice due to the realities of professional life. ^(Every nontrivial
    open source project will have an issue/PR queue, which necessitates a triage priority:
    not all issues and PRs are equal and it takes time and care to sift through the
    queue. That’s something I’ve had to repeatedly learn the hard way as a maintainer
    since accepting a misguided PR will create [technical debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt)
    and take even more effort to address.)'

    updated in awhile. That happens to me all the time. If the code still works, that’s
    excellent and I’m happy. But if it doesn’t, I move on, or use it as a fun new
    opportunity to hack it to my needs. That’s the beauty of open source! If there’s
    an inactive open source project that’s absolutely critical for your own commercial
    project, then that’s a good financial reason to offer a consulting contract or
    a bounty to add the appropriate functionality.

- en: One of the great things about open source is that if an open source project
    with a permissive license does become inactive, it can be [forked](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
    seamlessly. Sometimes the fork can become even better than the original project,
    which is great for everyone! But in my experience, it’s instead used as a *threat*.
    And it’s the maintainer’s fault for creating a reason for a fork to be made and
    fragment the development community.

- en: The AI industry is unique because it is indeed moving and evolving so fast that
    development expectations have shifted. Recent beneficiaries of the ChatGPT boon
    such as [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain), [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index),
    and [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT) have created a
    false sense that open source AI projects have to **always be shipping** 🚀🚀🚀. The
    difference is that they are maintained by those who do it as their full-time job
    and are now managed as companies backed by significant amounts of venture capital.

- en: The pressure to continually provide support for an open source project has become
    the biggest deterrent for me to continue my open source work. Personally, I’ve
    stopped pushing fun one-shot projects and AI models because I likely will not
    have the bandwidth to handle the inevitable “hi this is broken plz fix thx” DMs
    whenever a dependency on the project breaks years later. I’d gladly quit my professional
    job as a Data Scientist to work on my open source projects full-time if I was
    able to make an equivalent salary by doing so. Ultimately, the only way to make
    it work nowadays would be to raise venture capital like all those AI startups.

- en: The best-case scenario for asking if an open source project is dead is that
    you annoy the maintainers and delay development. The *worst*-case scenario is
    that you give the maintainers an opportunity to reconsider if continuing to work
    on the open source project is worth it.
