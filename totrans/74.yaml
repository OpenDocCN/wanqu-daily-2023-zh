- en: I made that first curl release and I’ve packaged every single release since.
    The day I did that first curl release I was 27 years old and I worked as a software
    engineer for **Frontec Tekniksystem**, where I mostly did contract development
    on embedded systems for larger Swedish product development companies. For a few
    years in the late 90s I would for example do quite a few projects at and for the
    telecom giant Ericsson.

    in the mid 80s. In the 1990s I had already established a daily schedule where
    I stayed up late when my better half went to bed at night, and I spent another
    hour or two on my spare time development. This is basically how I have manged
    to find time to devote to my projects the first few decades. Less sleep. Less
    other things.

    improve all aspects of it. Keep behavior, but enhance the code, add test cases,
    improve the documentation. Over and over, year after year. It never stops. As
    the timeline below helps showing.

- en: Similarly, there was no sudden specific moment when suddenly curl became popular
    and the number of users skyrocketed. Instead, the number of users and the popularity
    of the tool and library has gradually and continuously grown. In 1998 there were
    few users. By 2010 there were hundreds of millions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    are now. It is easy to estimate that it runs in **way more than ten billion installations**
    purely based on the fact that there are 7 billion smart phones and 1 billion tablets
    in the world , and we know that each of them run at least one, but likely many
    more curl installs.

    0.1 to automatically download currency rates daily to make my currency exchange
    converter work correctly for my IRC bot. httpget had some flaws so I sent back
    fixes, but Rafael, the author, quickly decided I could rather take over maintenance
    of the thing. So I did.
