    Rolexes, the Porsches of the world. Companies that proudly embrace their legacy,
    and ensure that enthusiasts can still service their camera, watch, or car, even
    if it's fifty-plus years old. What a beautiful model, and what a contrast to what
    passes for product dedication these days in the digital realm.

    service we've ever sold or offered running over the past twenty years. There's
    the occasional security updates that need applying, the relocation to new servers,
    and the continued monitoring of uptime. It's an expense, but an oh-so-worthwhile
    one.

    entirely, like it often does, it might well "evolve" in a direction you don't
    care for one bit. But what choice do you have? Almost all companies will simply
    tell you to get with the program, find where they hid the cheese now, and just
    be grateful that updates are even rolling out.

    exist for the customers who are happy to use it. And there are thousands of customers,
    generating millions in revenue, who are just that, happy with what they got. Not
    in the market for something new. And we are thrilled to serve them! Like I imagine
    a Rolex executive feeling a pang of pride when spotting a Daytona 6263 in the

    CRM, is still also used by thousands of companies, generating millions in revenue.
    Same too with Campfire, our old chat tool. Backpack, our old personal information
    manager. The revenue we make continuing to offer these services would never interest
    the likes of a Google, but so what? It makes us proud and our customers happy,
    do we need any other justification?
