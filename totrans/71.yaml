    That the output has streams, like one into the editor and one into the chat. That
    the LLM benefits from the opportunity to self criticize. That the UX needs diffs
    and in-situ things to home in on things. That search is as big a deal as chat.
    Many of our thumbs down reactions to [LLMs] come from them complaining they didn''t
    have the context of what language, file, codebase, etc. the user is talking about.
    Which bodes well because Sourcegraph should be able to do that really well.*'

    code. It has templated actions, such as writing unit tests, generating doc comments,
    summarizing code, that kind of thing. You know. Stuff you can choose from a menu.
    Like other assistants. It even has code completions, if you’re into that sort
    of thing.

    the context), are stuck using whatever context they can get from the IDE. But
    sadly for them, IDEs weren’t really designed with this use case in mind, and they
    make it difficult. And more damningly, no IDE scales up to industrial-sized code
    bases.

    powered by a world-class search engine and code knowledge graph.
