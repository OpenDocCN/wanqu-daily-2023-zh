- en: While trying to fix my printer today, I discovered that a PDF copy of Satoshi
    Nakamoto’s [Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) apparently shipped
    with every copy of macOS since Mojave in 2018.

- en: I’ve asked over a dozen Mac-using friends to confirm, and it was there for every
    one of them. The file is found in every version of macOS from Mojave (10.14.0)
    to the current version, Ventura (13.3), but isn’t in High Sierra (10.13) or earlier.
    **Update:** As [confirmed by 9to5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2023/04/25/apple-removes-bitcoin-whitepaper-from-macos/),
    it was removed in macOS Ventura 13.4 beta 3.

- en: In the Image Capture utility, the Bitcoin whitepaper is used as a sample document
    for a device called “Virtual Scanner II,” which is either hidden or not installed
    for everyone by default. It’s not clear why it’s hidden for some or what exactly
    it’s used for, but [Reid Beels](https://reidbeels.com/) suggested it may power
    the “Import from iPhone” feature.

    the Details, set the Media to “Document” and Media DPI to “72 DPI.” You should
    see the preview of the first page of the Bitcoin paper.

- en: Of all the documents in the world, why was the Bitcoin whitepaper chosen? Is
    there a secret Bitcoin maxi working at Apple? The filename is “simpledoc.pdf”
    and it’s only 184 KB. Maybe it was just a convenient, lightweight multipage PDF
    for testing purposes, never meant to be seen by end users.

    a couple references to “Virtual Driver II” or the whitepaper file in Google results.
    Namely, this Twitter thread from designer Joshua Dickens in November 2020, who
    also spotted the whitepaper PDF, inspiring [this Apple Community post](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252657375)
    in April 2021\. And that’s it!

    nearly a year ago, assigned to the same engineer who put the PDF there in the
    first place, and that person hasn’t taken action or commented on the issue since.
    They’ve indicated it will likely be removed in future versions.'
