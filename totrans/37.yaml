    a global success, but its beginnings were rather more humble. These are my memories
    of the earliest days of Linux, its creation, and the start of its path to where
    it is today.

    in the fall of 1988, and met Linus Torvalds, who was the other new Swedish speaking
    student in computer science that year. Toward the end of that first year, we had
    gotten access to a Unix server, and I accidentally found [Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet),
    the discussion system, by mistyping `rm` as `rn`, the Usenet reader. I told Linus
    about it and we spent way too much time exploring this.

    though in different places. We returned to our university studies in the fall
    of 1990, and both took the course on C and Unix programming, which included a
    fair bit of theory of the Unix kernel architecture as well. This led to us reading
    about other operating system kernels, such as [QNX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QNX)
    and [Plan 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs). Linus and I
    discussed with some enthusiasm how an operating system should be built correctly.
    We had all the overconfidence of 20-year-old second-year university students.
    Everyone is better off that this wasn't recorded for posterity.

    from a local shop that assembled computers from parts. The PC had a 386 CPU, which
    was relatively fancy at that time, because Linus wanted to explore multitasking.
    Also, since he came from a [Sinclair QL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_QL)
    with a 32-bit Motorola 68008 CPU, he wanted a 32-bit CPU, and did not want to
    step down to a 16-bit one, so a 286 was not an option. Linus's first PC had a
    whopping 4 megabytes of RAM and a hard drive.

    time for the next couple of months. He later also bought a copy of [MINIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minix),
    because after using Unix at the university, he wanted something like that at home
    as well.

    day he showed me a program that did multitasking. One task or thread would write
    a stream of the letter "A" on the screen, the other "B"; the context switches
    were visually obvious when the stream of As became Bs. This was the first version
    of what would later become known as the Linux kernel.

    time, late spring of 1991, I wrote an implementation of the C [`sprintf()`](https://linux.die.net/man/3/sprintf)
    function for him, as he hadn't yet learned how to write functions with variable
    argument lists. I wanted to spare him the pain of having a different function
    for every type of value to write out. The core of this code is still in the kernel,
    [as `snprintf()`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.3-rc6/source/lib/vsprintf.c#L2911).

    new things. After a while, he had drivers for the keyboard and the serial port,
    emulation of [VT100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100) terminal escape sequences
    for the screen, and could use it to dial via a modem to the university to read
    Usenet from home. Science fiction! One day, Linus accidentally attempted to use
    his hard drive to dial the university, resulting in his master boot sector starting
    with ["ATDT"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayes_AT_command_set) and the university
    modem-pool phone number. After recovering from this, he implemented file permissions
    in his kernel.

    in the `comp.os.minix` newsgroup. This included the phrase "<q>I'm doing a (free)
    operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu)</q>".
    Such humility. The system was initially called Freax. A few weeks later, Linus
    asked Ari Lemmke, one of the administrators of `ftp.funet.fi`, to do an upload
    of the first tar archive. Ari chose the name Linux. The initial version still
    contains the original name embedded in [one of the source files](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/0.01/source/kernel/Makefile).

    needed to provide an installation method and instructions. Since he only had one
    PC, he came to visit to install it on mine. Since his computer had been used to
    develop Linux, which had simply grown on top of his Minix installation, it had
    never actually been installed before. Thus, mine was the first PC where Linux
    was ever installed. While this was happening, I was taking a nap, and I recommend
    this method of installing Linux: napping, while Linus does the hard work.'

    of the early contributors suggested a change to a free-software license. In the
    fall of 1991, Richard Stallman visited Finland and I took Linus to a talk given
    by Stallman. This, the pressure from contributors, and my nagging eventually convinced
    Linus to choose the GNU GPL license instead, in early 1992.

    Linux a much more practical operating system on cheap machines with little memory.

    who is a university professor and the author of MINIX. He had some opinions about
    Linux and its architecture. Linus had opinions on MINIX. The debate has been described
    as a flame war, but was actually rather civil in hindsight.

    directly, and helped answer questions, write documentation, and such. I also ran
    a short-lived newsletter about Linux, which is mainly interesting for publishing
    the [first ever interview with Linus](https://liw.fi/linux-news/issue03/). The
    newsletter was effectively replaced by the `comp.os.linux.announce` newsgroup.

    to start Debian in 1993, in order to explore a more community-based development
    structure. A few other distributions would follow in the years to come.'

    We got to share an office. That room had a PC, which Linus took over, and used
    for Linux development. I was happy with a DEC terminal for Usenet access.

    the Linux kernel command-line parser in assembly language, for speed. (That was,
    of course, quite pointless, and the parser would later be rewritten again in C,
    for portability. Its speed does not matter.) A couple of years later, he spent
    days playing Quake, ostensibly to stress-test kernel memory management, although
    that was with a newer PC. Much fun was had in that room, and there were no pranks
    whatsoever. None at all.

    could read Usenet without having to use a modem. Alas, early Linux networking
    code was occasionally a little rough, having been written from scratch. At one
    point, Linux would send some broken packets that took down all of the Sun machines
    on the network. As it was difficult to get the Sun kernel fixed, Linux was banned
    from the university network until its bug was fixed. Not having Usenet access
    from one's desk is a great motivator.

    add. One could use Linux to compile itself, to read Usenet, and run many copies
    of the `xeyes` program at once. We decided to release version 1.0 and arranged
    a [release event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaDpjlFpbfo). The Finnish computer
    press was invited, and a TV station even sent a crew. Most of the event consisted
    of ceremonially compiling Linux 1.0 in the background, while Linus and others
    spoke about what Linux was and what it was good for. Linus explained that commercial
    Unix for a PC was so expensive that it was easier to write your own.

    mostly consisted of a large practical project. This was built on top of Linux,
    of course. I insisted that a version-control system be used. I had witnessed students
    in earlier courses do the shouting kind of version control: the students shared
    a source tree over NFS and shouted "I''m editing this file" when they were changing
    something. This did not seem like an effective method to me, so I insisted on
    [CVS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System), which I''d just
    learned about. This experience is why Linus dislikes CVS and for years refused
    to use any version control beyond uploading tar balls to FTP sites.'

    He'd been given a DEC Alpha machine. I would later get the machine to use as a
    terminal for reading Usenet. Other people ported Linux to other architectures,
    but that did not result in me getting any more machines to read Usenet on.

    still a few missing features from Linux, so people worked on those. The term "open
    source" was coined and IBM invested a ton of money in Linux development. Netscape
    published a version of its web browser as open source. Skipping a few details
    and many years, open source basically took over the world. LWN was started and
    covered much of this history on a week-by-week basis.

    devices, in orbit, and on Mars. Not bad for what started as two threads, writing
    streams of As and Bs on the screen.
