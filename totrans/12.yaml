    his friend and world-renowned chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1986, and the
    two men formed the country’s first computer club in Moscow. Pachikov and Kasparov

    convention that Evernote uses to this day. Even early on, Evernote’s functionality
    was impressive. Users could save all kinds of information within seconds. Digitized
    handwritten notes, audio recordings, links, pictures taken on a user’s mobile

- en: However, the real brilliance of Evernote was its search functionality, what
    Libin described as “the electronic version of having something at the tip of your
    tongue.” Users could search for saved items using an amazing range of search criteria,
    including date, keyword, topic, location, contacts, or any combination of the
    above. Users could even download add-ons that allowed notes to be searched by
    the dominant color of an image. This made it much easier to find saved notes,
    as users only had to recall a single detail to start a search, much like the way
    our memories work. This wasn’t just vital to Evernote’s core purpose. It was essential
    in recreating the rewarding, satisfying feeling of remembering something that

- en: Libin’s product philosophy was responsible for one of Evernote’s few hardware-based
    flaws—storing data natively on users’ machines and devices. Libin believed that
    a responsive feel was crucial to the Evernote experience, and that the delay between
    searching for something and finding something should be infinitesimal. This is
    the same principle that drove much of Spotify’s early development. Daniel Ek wanted
    [Spotify to feel like users had the entirety of the world’s music right on their
    hard drives](https://producthabits.com/how-spotify-built-a-20-billion-business-by-changing-how-people-listen-to-music/).
    Libin wanted the Evernote experience to feel similarly responsive, and believed
    that this would be central to user satisfaction with that experience.

    He believed that Evernote would become increasingly valuable to users the longer
    they used the product and the more they captured and stored within it. As such,
    Libin wanted to make Evernote as sticky as possible—and he did so by making the
    free version of the product incredibly generous. There were virtually no feature
    restrictions or other incentives for users to upgrade from free to paid plans.
    In fact, the only benefit of upgrading to a paid, $5-per-month subscription was
    additional storage space.

    3.5 million GB––of data on its [200 million users](https://www.statista.com/statistics/446885/number-of-evernote-users/).
    Evernote could have opted to use Amazon Web Services or Microsoft’s Azure infrastructure
    to host its data. The company reportedly chose Google as its cloud provider due
    to the potential applications of Google’s machine-learning technology. Despite
    the costs and sheer amount of work involved in the migration, the decision could
    have been seen as another small step toward Evernote becoming the company Stepan
    Pachikov envisioned all those years before. Evernote had long been rumored to
    be developing voice recognition and translation features to the product to make
    capturing information even easier. This made [Google’s Cloud Machine Learning
    Engine](https://cloud.google.com/customers/evernote/) the ideal choice for intelligent,

    Pachikov多年前设想的公司迈出的又一小步。长期以来，有传言称Evernote正在开发语音识别和翻译功能，以使信息捕捉变得更加容易。这使得[谷歌的云机器学习引擎](https://cloud.google.com/customers/evernote/)成为智能、响应迅速的功能，如语音识别的理想选择。
