    passionate community of users, and generous donors kept Thunderbird alive during
    some difficult times. Then, just last May, we [happily reported](https://blog.thunderbird.net/2022/05/thunderbird-2021-financial-report/)
    that Thunderbird’s financial outlook was steadily improving: our 2021 income had
    increased by 21% over 2020, and by more than 100% over 2018.'

    client and personal information manager available. To build professional software
    that puts your privacy first. To craft an experience that boosts your productivity,
    compliments your daily workflow, and meets your customization needs. And to expand
    the Thunderbird experience to Android and iOS. And to do all of this transparently,
    guided by the values of free and open source software.

    users – contributed a total of $6,442,704 in donations to the Thunderbird project.
    (*Note: user donations represent more than 99.9% of our annual revenue*.) Our
    2022 donation income was a bright, assertive sign that you also believe in that
    mission, and you also want to see Thunderbird thriving. Not just in 2023, but
    decades into the future!'

- en: The breakout growth we enjoyed last year means hiring even more talented people
    to vastly improve the Thunderbird desktop experience. This past year we expended
    significant effort to dramatically [improve Thunderbird’s UX](https://blog.thunderbird.net/2023/02/the-future-of-thunderbird-why-were-rebuilding-from-the-ground-up/)
    and bring it in-line with modern expectations and standards. In 2022 we also laid
    the groundwork for large architectural changes for Thunderbird on the desktop.
    These changes address many years of technical debt that has limited our ability
    to add new features at a brisk pace. This work will largely pay off in our 2024
    release, however it does power some of the improvements in the [115 “Supernova”](https://blog.thunderbird.net/tag/supernova/)
    release this summer.

    synergistic experience. Last summer we invested in the K-9 Mail Project, which
    is being steadily improved in its transformation to [Thunderbird on Android](https://blog.thunderbird.net/category/thunderbird-mobile/).
    And yes, we’re almost ready to add an iOS version to our roadmap! Later in 2023,
    we’ll hire an iOS developer to begin creating the foundation for Thunderbird on
    iOS.

    been exploring additional sources of revenue in the form of new tools and services
    to increase your productivity. We’re planning to introduce some of these, in Beta
    status, later this year. Rest assured that we have no plans to charge money for
    the powerful Thunderbird experience you enjoy today (nor do we plan to remove
    features and charge for them later).

    complacent. We are careful stewards of the thoughtful donations we receive from
    you. We don’t just use it to enhance features; we invest it strategically towards
    ensuring long-term stability and viability of Thunderbird. Having healthy cash
    reserves ensures the long-term sustainability of Thunderbird, even during periods
    of economic instability.
