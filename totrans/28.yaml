    on specialized chips from Chinese companies like Bitmain or Nasdaq-listed Canaan.
    These mining rigs are often bundled together into vast energy-hungry data centers.

    flown destinations like Paraguay, which also has immense hydropower capacity,
    have drawn hoards of miners. Still, several of the largest mining operators like
    Core Scientific and Compute North filed for bankruptcy after bitcoin prices plunged
    and energy prices soared in the last year.

    Scientific和Compute North在比特币价格暴跌和能源价格飙升后申请破产。

    country has a massive hydropower capacity compared to its small population and
    produces a similar amount of electricity per capita as the United States — a much
    wealthier country,” says Jaran Mellerud, bitcoin mining analyst with Luxor. “This
    cheap, stranded hydropower is undoubtedly alluring for miners whose sole job is

    for senior Bhutan officials to begin talks with bitcoin miners, and mining suppliers.
    Bhutan, which was closed to foreigners until 1974, again sealed its borders for
    almost two years to shelter its population of 800,000 from Covid-19\. (The country
    famously staved off the virus for months [until its first case](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/02/coronavirus-pandemic-bhutan/617976/
    "https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/02/coronavirus-pandemic-bhutan/617976/")
    was reported in an American tourist in January 2021, which prompted the lockdown.)
    The country has claimed only 21 Covid-19 deaths to date, but the pandemic devastated
    its tourism industry, which is core to its economy. Bhutan has championed several
    novel economic concepts in the past like its Gross National Happiness index, and
    high-end tourism, with well-heeled visitors being hit with visa fees of $200 per
    day.

  zh: 知情人士告诉*福布斯*，疫情是导致不丹高级官员开始与比特币矿工和采矿供应商进行谈判的导火索。不丹自1974年对外国人关闭边境，再次封闭边境近两年以保护其80万人口免受Covid-19的影响。（这个国家以前曾数月抵御病毒，直到2021年1月一名美国游客报告了[第一个病例](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/02/coronavirus-pandemic-bhutan/617976/
    "https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/02/coronavirus-pandemic-bhutan/617976/")，这促使了封锁。）该国迄今仅报告了21例Covid-19死亡，但疫情摧毁了其旅游业，这对其经济至关重要。不丹过去曾提倡过几种新颖的经济概念，如其国民幸福总值指数和高端旅游，富裕游客每天需支付200美元的签证费。
