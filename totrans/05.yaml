    software is still pretty dumb.

    You can use Microsoft Word and Google Docs to draft a business proposal, but they
    can’t help you send an email, share a selfie, analyze data, schedule a party,
    or buy movie tickets. And even the best sites have an incomplete understanding
    of your work, personal life, interests, and relationships and a limited ability
    to use this information to do things for you. That’s the kind of thing that is
    only possible today with another human being, like a close friend or personal
    assistant.

    apps for different tasks. You’ll simply tell your device, in everyday language,
    what you want to do. And depending on how much information you choose to share
    with it, the software will be able to respond personally because it will have
    a rich understanding of your life. In the near future, anyone who’s online will
    be able to have a personal assistant powered by artificial intelligence that’s
    far beyond today’s technology.

    many different tasks based on its knowledge of the user—is called an agent. I’ve
    been thinking about agents for nearly 30 years and wrote about them in my 1995
    book [*The Road Ahead*](https://www.gatesnotes.com/The-Road-Ahead-after-25-years),
    but they’ve only recently become practical because of advances in AI.

    Why will people use agents?

    conversations with them. They will be much more personalized, and they won’t be
    limited to relatively simple tasks like writing a letter. Clippy has as much in
    common with agents as a rotary phone has with a mobile device.

    and schedule. You’ll choose how and when it steps in to help with something or

    AI tools available today. Most of these are bots. They’re limited to one app and
    generally only step in when you write a particular word or ask for help. Because
    they don’t remember how you use them from one time to the next, they don’t get
    better or learn any of your preferences. Clippy was a bot, not an agent.

    ask for them. They accomplish tasks across applications. They improve over time
    because they remember your activities and recognize intent and patterns in your
    behavior. Based on this information, they offer to provide what they think you
    need, although you will always make the final decisions.

    fit your budget. An agent will know what time of year you’ll be traveling and,
    based on its knowledge about whether you always try a new destination or like
    to return to the same place repeatedly, it will be able to suggest locations.
    When asked, it will recommend things to do based on your interests and propensity
    for adventure, and it will book reservations at the types of restaurants you would
    enjoy. If you want this kind of deeply personalized planning today, you need to
    pay a travel agent and spend time telling them what you want.

    advice about how to deal with health problems, and decide whether they need to

    to share enough information with a mental health agent, it will understand your
    life history and your relationships. It’ll be available when you need it, and
    it will never get impatient. It could even, with your permission, monitor your
    physical responses to therapy through your smart watch—like if your heart starts
    to race when you’re talking about a problem with your boss—and suggest when you
    should see a human therapist.

    to supplement their classroom work. If agents can capture what makes a tutor effective,
    they’ll unlock this supplemental instruction for everyone who wants it. If a tutoring
    agent knows that a kid likes Minecraft and Taylor Swift, it will use Minecraft
    to teach them about calculating the volume and area of shapes, and Taylor’s lyrics
    to teach them about storytelling and rhyme schemes. The experience will be far
    richer—with graphics and sound, for example—and more personalized than today’s

    to helping you with various tasks and doing them independently if you want. If
    you have an idea for a business, an agent will help you write up a business plan,
    create a presentation for it, and even generate images of what your product might
    look like. Companies will be able to make agents available for their employees
    to consult directly and be part of every meeting so they can answer questions.

    If you tell your agent that you want to watch *Star Wars*, it will know whether
    you’re subscribed to the right streaming service, and if you aren’t, it will offer

    price for you and won’t be restricted to just a few vendors. They’ll replace word

    own. Although some agents will be free to use (and supported by ads), I think
    you’ll pay for most of them, which means companies will have an incentive to make
    agents work on your behalf and not an advertiser’s. If the number of companies
    that have started working on AI just this year is any indication, there will be
    an exceptional amount of competition, which will make agents very inexpensive.

    or show up on your phone. (“Your flight is delayed. Do you want to wait, or can
    I help rebook it?”) If you want, it will monitor sound coming into your ear and

    especially in areas like health where accuracy is super-important, and make sure
    that agents don’t harm people as a result of their biases. And we don’t want agents
