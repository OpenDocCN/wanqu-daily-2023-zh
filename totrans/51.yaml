- en: We vastly overvalue the idea of “ideas” in design. Meaningful additions to the
    world rest on novel connections among pre-existing concepts, objects and situations,
    not self-indulgent originality for its own sake. What we glorify as flashes of
    brilliance are usually astute observations about the world, improved by critical
    thinking and critique. And observations often begin from a question.

    answers and clever ideas, in school as well as in professional life, the questioning
    and critiquing part of design can get very uncomfortable. So much easier to sink
    into the fluffy pillow of groupthink.

- en: Brainstorming ideas and solutions together is an extremely popular activity
    because it *feels* collaborative and creativity-enhancing even when it’s really
    not. [Research has shown group brainstorming to be a waste of time](https://hbr.org/2015/03/why-group-brainstorming-is-a-waste-of-time).
    In addition, brainstorming ideas is often anti-collaborative. Everyone secretly,
    or not so secretly, wants their contribution to "win". And once you frame an exercise
    as “there are no bad ideas”, well, that’s how you get ants, and really bad ideas
    that make it out into the world because no one wants to be the bummer or stick
    their neck out or kill that one lovely darling that already made it into a prototype
    so we might as well ship it. The Emperor's New Clothes plays out on the daily.

- en: A quick and effective fix is to stop brainstorming ideas with your team, and
    start brainstorming questions instead. Getting together and listing every question
    you can think of about a problem, a process, or a situation is uncomfortable at
    first, and then in very short order enhances collaboration, decreases risk and
    puts you on the path to being a learning organization.

    it out in the open contributes to shared understanding and shared goals, and is
    far more efficient than pretending mutual understanding. You can fire up the Mystery
    Machine and investigate together.

- en: Excuses to avoid asking questions abound just because it can feel so risky and
    uncomfortable and daunting at first. So, frame the first try as just that. Take
    an hour, or even 30 minutes, just to get a bunch out and roughly sorted.

    smallest questions, so give it to them. Depending on the group, you may need to
    prep a couple of more senior people in advance and ask them to model admitting
    what they don’t know.
