- en: I retired a year and a half ago after having worked for twenty-six years as
    a programmer for Apple. I’m not sure which would have been more surprising: if
    I had continued programming in my spare time after I had retired or if I never
    programmed again.

  zh: 一年半前，我在苹果公司担任程序员工作了二十六年后退休了。我不确定哪种情况更令人惊讶：如果我退休后继续在业余时间编程，还是永远不再编程。
- en: I suppose most people would not be surprised by, perhaps might expect the latter
    to be the case — might expect that I would hang up the keyboard after I retire
    in the same way we expect that a retired doctor probably stops performing surgeries
    and begins to spend more time on the golf course.

  zh: 我想大多数人可能不会感到惊讶，也许会预料到后一种情况——可能会预料到我退休后会放下键盘，就像我们预料到退休的医生可能停止做手术，开始更多时间在高尔夫球场上度过一样。
- en: In fact right after retirement there was a sense of relief that I would never
    again have to step through code trying to determine why a dispatch to a background
    thread never completed. No longer would I have to worry about completely screwing
    up the project repo because of my misadventures with git.

  zh: 事实上，退休后的那段时间，我感到一种解脱，再也不必为了弄清为什么后台线程的调度没有完成而逐行查看代码。我再也不必担心因为我在git上的冒险而完全搞砸项目仓库。
- en: The respite from programming though lasted maybe about four months after retiring.
    I started a [small project](https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/SystemSix) , in
    part to learn Python, in part to play with e-ink displays. I was back programming
    (back abusing git) but of course the pressure was off. It both was and wasn’t
    like the day job I had left behind.

  zh: 尽管退休后的编程休息可能只持续了大约四个月。我开始了一个[小项目](https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/SystemSix)，部分是为了学习Python，部分是为了玩电子墨水显示器。我又开始编程了（又开始滥用git），但当然压力已经解除了。这既是又不是我离开的那份工作。

- en: I should mention though that before my twenty-six years at Apple, I had originally
    been writing shareware games for fun and, a few years after that, a few commercial
    games for a living. Since programming had initially been a kind of hobby to me
    it is probably less surprising then that I would eventually return to writing
    code.

  zh: 我应该提一下，在苹果公司工作了二十六年之前，我最初是为了好玩而写共享软件游戏，之后几年为了生计写了一些商业游戏。由于编程最初对我来说是一种爱好，所以我最终会回到编写代码上可能就不那么令人惊讶了。
- en: I am not sure though if this is still the case for software engineers. Are there
    younger engineers, new to the career, for whom programming is not merely a job
    but something they can imagine doing in their spare time? I think I met a few
    as I was winding down my career. I do feel though that back around 1988 or so
    when I started getting serious into programming that *all* fellow programmers
    I met were also doing it with a kind of passion. How is it you can love a machine?

  zh: 尽管我不确定这对软件工程师是否仍然适用。是否有年轻的工程师，刚刚开始职业生涯，对编程不仅仅是一份工作，而是他们可以想象在业余时间做的事情？我想我在结束职业生涯时遇到了一些。然而，我确实感觉到，大约在1988年左右，当我开始认真学习编程时，我遇到的*所有*同行程序员也都是出于一种激情在做这件事。你怎么会爱上一台机器呢？
- en: I dabbled with [writing a game in Javascript](https://www.mooncraft2000.com)
    after my Python foray. And then roughly a year after I retired I went back to
    Python to write an application this time.

- en: But this year, 2023, I find myself suddenly on a kind of tear. Though I eventually
    began programming again, in the first fourteen months of retirement I did all
    manner of other things in my spare time as well. I kept also-busy with woodworking
    projects, experiments learning Blender and 3D printing, bike riding — just to
    name a few. But somehow this year I have found myself tipping head-long back into
    full-time programming. It is distinctly reminding me of my sleepless days spent
    writing shareware games for the Macintosh thirty-five years ago.

  zh: 但是在2023年，我突然发现自己陷入了某种狂热状态。尽管最终我又开始编程了，但在退休的头十四个月里，我还做了各种其他事情。我还忙于木工项目、学习Blender和3D打印的实验、骑自行车等等。但不知何故，今年我发现自己又开始全职编程。这让我明显地想起了三十五年前为Macintosh编写共享软件游戏时度过的无眠日子。
- en: I’m not sure if that is a good thing. I am back to coding late into the night,
    and back at it after coffee and an English muffin the following morning (thankfully
    though I quit the cigarettes decades ago). Programming is beginning again to be
    to the exclusion of all else in my life. (The table saw sits slowly rusting. The
    bike hangs on the wall in the garage.)

  zh: 我不确定这是好事。我又开始在深夜编程，第二天早晨喝完咖啡和吃完英式松饼后又开始编程（幸运的是，几十年前我戒烟了）。编程又开始逐渐成为我生活中排他性的事情。（台锯慢慢生锈。自行车挂在车库墙上。）
- en: And just to further complete the circle, it's not Javascript or Python (or Swift)
    that is calling to me, but my old nemesis C. And further, I have this desire to
    revisit/rewrite some of the shareware games that I wrote over three decades ago.

- en: 'From here I could go into detail on any number of things: working for Apple
    in the 90’s vs. working for Apple post-iPhone, why something that others would
    consider a job (programming) some do for fun, why game authoring appeals to both
    sides of the brain.'

- en: I guess at this moment though I am simply marveling at having hopped off the
    career train only to find I have come full circle — somehow got off at the same
    stop where I got on. Perhaps I can talk about some of those other things in the
    future.

- en: Laughably, I’m reminded of the last MST3K episode where Mike and the ‘bots finally
    get back to Earth only to plop down in front of a TV to watch “The Crawling Eye”,
    one of the first films they riffed a decade earlier.

- en: Or maybe I’m just an old guy looking back and romanticizing the early days.
    I’m back to coding in C again, writing little inconsequential games to amuse myself.
    Or maybe there was something a little magical then. Simpler times?

    hitting command-S to save my progress every few minutes — no dial-up modem (ha
    ha, no land line). I comb through StackOverflow like everyone else trying to figure
    out why toggling fullscreen mode trashes the SDL_Textures I marked as targetable.

- en: But there is something becoming more familiar to me as I go back to the wild
    west of C programming (where very little happens *behind the scenes* I might point
    out - no garbage collection here!). And so [why not rewrite some familiar little
