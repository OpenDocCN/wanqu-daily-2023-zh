- en: I retired a year and a half ago after having worked for twenty-six years as
    a programmer for Apple. I’m not sure which would have been more surprising: if
    I had continued programming in my spare time after I had retired or if I never
    programmed again.

    to be the case — might expect that I would hang up the keyboard after I retire
    in the same way we expect that a retired doctor probably stops performing surgeries
    and begins to spend more time on the golf course.

    again have to step through code trying to determine why a dispatch to a background
    thread never completed. No longer would I have to worry about completely screwing
    up the project repo because of my misadventures with git.

- en: The respite from programming though lasted maybe about four months after retiring.
    I started a [small project](https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/SystemSix) , in
    part to learn Python, in part to play with e-ink displays. I was back programming
    (back abusing git) but of course the pressure was off. It both was and wasn’t
    like the day job I had left behind.

    been writing shareware games for fun and, a few years after that, a few commercial
    games for a living. Since programming had initially been a kind of hobby to me
    it is probably less surprising then that I would eventually return to writing
    code.

- en: I am not sure though if this is still the case for software engineers. Are there
    younger engineers, new to the career, for whom programming is not merely a job
    but something they can imagine doing in their spare time? I think I met a few
    as I was winding down my career. I do feel though that back around 1988 or so
    when I started getting serious into programming that *all* fellow programmers
    I met were also doing it with a kind of passion. How is it you can love a machine?

    after my Python foray. And then roughly a year after I retired I went back to
    Python to write an application this time.

- en: But this year, 2023, I find myself suddenly on a kind of tear. Though I eventually
    began programming again, in the first fourteen months of retirement I did all
    manner of other things in my spare time as well. I kept also-busy with woodworking
    projects, experiments learning Blender and 3D printing, bike riding — just to
    name a few. But somehow this year I have found myself tipping head-long back into
    full-time programming. It is distinctly reminding me of my sleepless days spent
    writing shareware games for the Macintosh thirty-five years ago.

    and back at it after coffee and an English muffin the following morning (thankfully
    though I quit the cigarettes decades ago). Programming is beginning again to be
    to the exclusion of all else in my life. (The table saw sits slowly rusting. The
    bike hangs on the wall in the garage.)

    that is calling to me, but my old nemesis C. And further, I have this desire to
    revisit/rewrite some of the shareware games that I wrote over three decades ago.

    in the 90’s vs. working for Apple post-iPhone, why something that others would
    consider a job (programming) some do for fun, why game authoring appeals to both
    sides of the brain.'

    career train only to find I have come full circle — somehow got off at the same
    stop where I got on. Perhaps I can talk about some of those other things in the
    future.

    get back to Earth only to plop down in front of a TV to watch “The Crawling Eye”,

    I’m back to coding in C again, writing little inconsequential games to amuse myself.
    Or maybe there was something a little magical then. Simpler times?

    hitting command-S to save my progress every few minutes — no dial-up modem (ha
    ha, no land line). I comb through StackOverflow like everyone else trying to figure
    out why toggling fullscreen mode trashes the SDL_Textures I marked as targetable.

    west of C programming (where very little happens *behind the scenes* I might point
    out - no garbage collection here!). And so [why not rewrite some familiar little
    games](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2318420/Glypha_Vintage) as well?
