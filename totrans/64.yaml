    initially served as executive vice president until 1975, when he became president.
    In 1979, Moore was named chairman of the board and chief executive officer, posts
    he held until 1987, when he gave up the CEO position and continued as chairman.
    In 1997, Moore became chairman emeritus, stepping down in 2006.

    particularly environmental conservation, science and patient care improvements.
    Along with his wife of 72 years, he established the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation,
    which has donated more than $5.1 billion to charitable causes since its founding
    in 2000.

    his wisdom, humility and generosity,” reflected foundation president Harvey Fineberg.
    “Though he never aspired to be a household name, Gordon’s vision and his life’s
    work enabled the phenomenal innovation and technological developments that shape
    our everyday lives. Yet those historic achievements are only part of his legacy.
    His and Betty’s generosity as philanthropists will shape the world for generations
    to come.”

    through his insight and vision. He was instrumental in revealing the power of
    transistors, and inspired technologists and entrepreneurs across the decades.
    We at Intel remain inspired by Moore’s Law, and intend to pursue it until the
    periodic table is exhausted. Gordon’s vision lives on as our true north as we
    use the power of technology to improve the lives of every person on Earth. My
    career and much of my life took shape within the possibilities fueled by Gordon’s
    leadership at the helm of Intel, and I am humbled by the honor and responsibility
    to carry his legacy forward.”

    brilliant scientist and one of America’s leading entrepreneurs and business leaders.
    It is impossible to imagine the world we live in today, with computing so essential
    to our lives, without the contributions of Gordon Moore. He will always be an
    inspiration to our Intel family and his thinking at the core of our innovation
    culture.”

    who sought to make the world better and always do the right thing. It was a privilege
    to know him, and I am grateful that his legacy lives on in the culture of the
    company he helped to create.”

    Fairchild Semiconductor, where they played central roles in the first commercial
    production of diffused silicon transistors and later the world’s first commercially
    viable integrated circuits. The two had previously worked together under William
    Shockley, the co-inventor of the transistor and founder of Shockley Semiconductor,
    which was the first semiconductor company established in what would become Silicon
    Valley. Upon striking out on their own, Moore and Noyce hired future Intel CEO
    Andy Grove as the third employee, and the three of them built Intel into one of
    the world’s great companies. Together they became known as the “Intel Trinity,”
    and their legacy continues today.

    technology companies, he famously forecast in 1965 that the number of transistors
    on an integrated circuit would double every year – a prediction that came to be
    known as Moore’s Law.

    more stuff on a chip we were going to make all electronics cheaper,” Moore said
    in a 2008 interview.

- en: With his 1965 prediction proven correct, in 1975 Moore revised his estimate
    to the doubling of transistors on an integrated circuit every two years for the
    next 10 years. Regardless, the idea of chip technology growing at an exponential
    rate, continually making electronics faster, smaller and cheaper, became the driving
    force behind the semiconductor industry and paved the way for the ubiquitous use
    of chips in millions of everyday products.

    and Florence Almira “Mira” (Williamson) Moore. Moore was educated at San Jose
    State University, the University of California at Berkeley, and the California
    Institute of Technology, where he was awarded a Ph.D. in chemistry in 1954.

    in Maryland. He returned to California in 1956 to join Shockley Semiconductor.
    In 1957, Moore co-founded Fairchild Semiconductor, a division of Fairchild Camera
    and Instrument, along with Robert Noyce and six other colleagues from Shockley
    Semiconductor. Eleven years later, Moore and Noyce co-founded Intel.

    many of them anonymous, then forming the Moore Family Foundation, and eventually,
    in 2000, creating the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Moore and his wife sought
    through philanthropy to make the world a better place for future generations.
    His passion for impact and measurement were hallmarks of his philanthropic work
    and aspirations.
