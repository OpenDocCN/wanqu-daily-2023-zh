    they feel it’s time well spent, according to a 2023 AARP Research study.

    them have fun and relax while also staying mentally sharp and being challenged.
    Older gamers invest both their time and money — on average, 12 hours of play per
    week and $49 within a six-month time frame — on their gaming.  In 2023, older
    adults’ continued interest in gaming could lead to $2.5 billion in biannual spending
    on digital and physical game content (in-app purchases, virtual items, customization
    features), accessories (headsets, controllers, microphones), and hardware (gaming
    consoles, handheld devices).

    sample of U.S. adults ages 40-plus who own a gaming-eligible device and play video
    games on that device at least once a month. The survey was conducted June 23,
    2022 to July 13, 2022\. Data were weighted using population benchmarks from NORC’s
    population survey for age, gender, division, race/ethnicity, education, housing
    tenure, household phone status, age x gender and age x race/ethnicity. Survey
    length — median gamers (32 min.); nongamers (7 min.). Sample = 7,885 completes
    (5,953 50-plus gamers/2,630 40-plus nongamers).
