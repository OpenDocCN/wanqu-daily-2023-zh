    back in [2014](https://steveridout.com/2014/03/22/readlang-my-bootstrapped-language-learning-web-app.html),
    and then again in [2016](https://steveridout.com/2016/01/04/readlang-3-years-as-a-one-man-startup.html),
    both times attracting attention on Hacker News, where my story of a struggling
    one-man startup seemed to resonate. Well, it’s now 7 years later, and a bunch
    has happened since, so it’s time for an update…

- en: My Readlang story caught the attention of Duolingo and I went to work there
    in 2016\. Meeting them for the first time on their company vacation at a fancy
    resort in Costa Rica was a culture shock after my frugal bootstrapper lifestyle.
    “You’ll get used to it” said one of the other engineers, which turned out to be
    half right. It was a wonderful, surreal experience.

  zh: 我的 Readlang 故事引起了 Duolingo 的注意，于是我在2016年去那里工作了。第一次在哥斯达黎加一个豪华度假胜地与他们见面对我这个过着节俭生活的自给自足者来说是一次文化冲击。另一位工程师说：“你会习惯的”，结果证明他说对了一半。那是一次美妙而超现实的经历。
- en: We talked about a potential Readlang sale before I joined Duolingo. But they
    were more excited for me to work for on other projects. It sounded like an aquihire
    which made me uncomfortable. So instead we agreed that I would work for them for
    a while and keep Readlang on the side. I spent the first 9 months working on an
    [ill-fated chatbot](https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/06/duolingos-chatbots-help-you-learn-a-new-language/)
    (a few years too early [as it turns out](https://blog.duolingo.com/duolingo-max/)).
    After this, I decided that I had unfinished business and emailed to say that I’d
    be leaving to work on Readlang again. They quickly got back to me and said I could
    have carte-blanche to work on a completely new product around listening. I had
    ideas in this area already, and it seemed too cool to turn down. Get paid to hack
    together a new prototype that I would be in charge of? Yes please!

  zh: 在我加入 Duolingo 之前，我们曾讨论过潜在的 Readlang 出售。但他们更希望我为其他项目工作。这听起来像是一次人才收购，让我感到不舒服。所以我们同意我会在那里工作一段时间，同时继续保留
    Readlang。我在那里的头9个月里致力于一个[注定失败的聊天机器人](https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/06/duolingos-chatbots-help-you-learn-a-new-language/)（结果证明为时过早[如今看来](https://blog.duolingo.com/duolingo-max/)）。之后，我决定我还有未竟的事业，于是发邮件说我要离开重新开始做
    Readlang。他们很快回复我说我可以全权负责开发一个全新的关于听力的产品。我已经在这个领域有了一些想法，而且这个机会太棒了，无法拒绝。拿钱来开发一个我负责的全新原型？当然愿意！
- en: My idea was to launch an MVP and then leave to work on Readlang again. Within
    a few months we launched the first version of Duolingo Stories and the reception
    both internally and externally was really promising. So much so that I was now
    pretty excited to continue growing it. It seemed we were onto something. Given
    that Stories was kinda similar to Readlang, it felt weird for me to be running
    Readlang on the side, so I brought up the option of a sale again with the idea
    that I’d either go all in with Duolingo or leave for Readlang. I figured that
    eventually I’d either work on Readlang inside Duolingo or Stories might even evolve
    to become a replacement for Readlang. So we did the deal. We migrated the site
    to run on their infrastructure and the customer’s payments went to Duolingo’s
    Stripe account instead of mine. Beyond that, nothing much changed with Readlang.
    Stories grew, but it never did turn into a Readlang replacement. I occasionally
    thought about pitching Readlang as a project to focus on, but I could never convince
    myself that it would move the needle at Duolingo’s scale, and so it was neglected.

  zh: 我的想法是推出一个MVP，然后离开，再次致力于Readlang。几个月内，我们推出了Duolingo Stories的第一个版本，内部和外部的反响都非常积极。以至于我现在非常兴奋地继续发展它。看起来我们找到了一些东西。鉴于Stories有点类似于Readlang，我觉得在一边经营Readlang有点奇怪，所以我再次提出了出售的选项，要么全力以赴Duolingo，要么离开Readlang。我想最终我要么在Duolingo内部工作Readlang，要么Stories甚至可能发展成为Readlang的替代品。所以我们达成了交易。我们将网站迁移到他们的基础设施上，客户的付款转到了Duolingo的Stripe账户，而不是我的。除此之外，Readlang没有太多变化。Stories在增长，但从未成为Readlang的替代品。我偶尔会考虑将Readlang作为一个要专注的项目，但我无法说服自己它会在Duolingo的规模上产生影响，因此它被忽视了。

    and with it, Readlang. I left instructions on how to maintain Readlang but figured
    that one day something would break, and there was a good chance they’d want to
    shut it down. I said that if it ever got to that point to please get in touch
    with me.

    [Flashdown](https://github.com/SteveRidout/flashdown), [Notepad Calculator](https://notepadcalculator.com/)),
    until in December I got 3 emails from random people complaining about payments
    being taken by Readlang that they had no idea about. To get 3 emails to my personal
    email was pretty strange. I asked Duolingo and they confirmed that something was
    going wrong. It turned out that people were using Readlang for [card testing fraud](https://stripe.com/docs/disputes/prevention/card-testing).
    After I helped them to fix the problem and refund everyone they asked if I wanted
    Readlang back and how much I’d pay. Of course I said yes!

- en: The first few years show good growth. During this time I was constantly adding
    new features, blogging about it, and it largely spread organically with enthusiastic
    users sharing it in different online and offline communities. After putting it
    maintenance mode in early 2016 it continued growing until the sale to Duolingo.
    At this point we dropped PayPal for simplicity resulting in a dip but after that
    revenue held surprisingly constant. About 10% of users were churning each month
    but the supply of new users never dried up. People continued to recommend Readlang,
    it even appeared in one of Tim Ferriss’ “5 Bullet Friday” newsletters in 2018!
    There was a noticeable bump in 2020 likely driven by the pandemic lockdowns.

  zh: 最初几年显示出良好的增长。在这段时间里，我不断添加新功能，写博客介绍它，它主要是在热情的用户在不同的线上和线下社区分享的情况下有机地传播开来。在2016年初将其置于维护模式后，直到出售给Duolingo，它仍在持续增长。在这一点上，我们为了简化而放弃了PayPal，导致了一次下降，但之后收入奇迹般地保持稳定。每个月大约有10%的用户流失，但新用户的供应从未枯竭。人们继续推荐Readlang，甚至在2018年出现在蒂姆·费里斯的“五弹星期五”通讯中！2020年有一个明显的增长，很可能是由于大流行封锁所推动的。

    Recently I experimented with adding ChatGPT-powered [Smart Definitions](https://blog.readlang.com/2023/03/23/smart-definitions.html).
    But I think the most important thing is to improve the streak mechanic to get
    people more invested in returning every day - did I mention I worked at Duolingo?
    :-) If I manage to improve growth then I might even think about re-investing the
    profits and get someone else to help out. It’s not like I’m committed to this
    one-man-startup approach forever!
