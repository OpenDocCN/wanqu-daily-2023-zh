    back in [2014](https://steveridout.com/2014/03/22/readlang-my-bootstrapped-language-learning-web-app.html),
    and then again in [2016](https://steveridout.com/2016/01/04/readlang-3-years-as-a-one-man-startup.html),
    both times attracting attention on Hacker News, where my story of a struggling
    one-man startup seemed to resonate. Well, it’s now 7 years later, and a bunch
    has happened since, so it’s time for an update…

- en: My Readlang story caught the attention of Duolingo and I went to work there
    in 2016\. Meeting them for the first time on their company vacation at a fancy
    resort in Costa Rica was a culture shock after my frugal bootstrapper lifestyle.
    “You’ll get used to it” said one of the other engineers, which turned out to be
    half right. It was a wonderful, surreal experience.

- en: We talked about a potential Readlang sale before I joined Duolingo. But they
    were more excited for me to work for on other projects. It sounded like an aquihire
    which made me uncomfortable. So instead we agreed that I would work for them for
    a while and keep Readlang on the side. I spent the first 9 months working on an
    [ill-fated chatbot](https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/06/duolingos-chatbots-help-you-learn-a-new-language/)
    (a few years too early [as it turns out](https://blog.duolingo.com/duolingo-max/)).
    After this, I decided that I had unfinished business and emailed to say that I’d
    be leaving to work on Readlang again. They quickly got back to me and said I could
    have carte-blanche to work on a completely new product around listening. I had
    ideas in this area already, and it seemed too cool to turn down. Get paid to hack
    together a new prototype that I would be in charge of? Yes please!

- en: My idea was to launch an MVP and then leave to work on Readlang again. Within
    a few months we launched the first version of Duolingo Stories and the reception
    both internally and externally was really promising. So much so that I was now
    pretty excited to continue growing it. It seemed we were onto something. Given
    that Stories was kinda similar to Readlang, it felt weird for me to be running
    Readlang on the side, so I brought up the option of a sale again with the idea
    that I’d either go all in with Duolingo or leave for Readlang. I figured that
    eventually I’d either work on Readlang inside Duolingo or Stories might even evolve
    to become a replacement for Readlang. So we did the deal. We migrated the site
    to run on their infrastructure and the customer’s payments went to Duolingo’s
    Stripe account instead of mine. Beyond that, nothing much changed with Readlang.
    Stories grew, but it never did turn into a Readlang replacement. I occasionally
    thought about pitching Readlang as a project to focus on, but I could never convince
    myself that it would move the needle at Duolingo’s scale, and so it was neglected.

    and with it, Readlang. I left instructions on how to maintain Readlang but figured
    that one day something would break, and there was a good chance they’d want to
    shut it down. I said that if it ever got to that point to please get in touch
    with me.

    [Flashdown](https://github.com/SteveRidout/flashdown), [Notepad Calculator](https://notepadcalculator.com/)),
    until in December I got 3 emails from random people complaining about payments
    being taken by Readlang that they had no idea about. To get 3 emails to my personal
    email was pretty strange. I asked Duolingo and they confirmed that something was
    going wrong. It turned out that people were using Readlang for [card testing fraud](https://stripe.com/docs/disputes/prevention/card-testing).
    After I helped them to fix the problem and refund everyone they asked if I wanted
    Readlang back and how much I’d pay. Of course I said yes!

    if I just abandoned it and left it in maintanence mode for all this time, I would
    have bet that it would have declined, but actually, it basically held steady.
    Here’s a monthly revenue graph:'

- en: The first few years show good growth. During this time I was constantly adding
    new features, blogging about it, and it largely spread organically with enthusiastic
    users sharing it in different online and offline communities. After putting it
    maintenance mode in early 2016 it continued growing until the sale to Duolingo.
    At this point we dropped PayPal for simplicity resulting in a dip but after that
    revenue held surprisingly constant. About 10% of users were churning each month
    but the supply of new users never dried up. People continued to recommend Readlang,
    it even appeared in one of Tim Ferriss’ “5 Bullet Friday” newsletters in 2018!
    There was a noticeable bump in 2020 likely driven by the pandemic lockdowns.

- en: I have ideas. And of course there are more ideas that time to implement them.
    Recently I experimented with adding ChatGPT-powered [Smart Definitions](https://blog.readlang.com/2023/03/23/smart-definitions.html).
    But I think the most important thing is to improve the streak mechanic to get
    people more invested in returning every day - did I mention I worked at Duolingo?
    :-) If I manage to improve growth then I might even think about re-investing the
    profits and get someone else to help out. It’s not like I’m committed to this
    one-man-startup approach forever!
