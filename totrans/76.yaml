    business world, I didn''t think much about bank choice. I figured: you put money
    in, you take money out, they''re all the same. I also figured a local branch of
    a global bank is just a fungible tentacle of the giant banking machine, so also...
    who cares. Both incorrect assumptions, but let''s relive and rediscover the effect
    of these assumptions as I did.'

    of Los Angeles. I have time to kill during one of the days so I drive down to
    the nearest Chase bank branch and open a business banking account. We'll call
    the person who helped me at the local branch Alex (this will be important later).
    I fund that account with a $20,000 personal loan which was almost all of my savings.
    I get an account number, an online login, and *boom, we're in business!*

    banking account information for the wire, and at close the funding is wired to
    the account. I am sitting in a cafe in downtown San Francisco and I receive a
    call from an unknown number -- it''s Alex, the banker that helped me open my account.
    He is being very casual, sort of like "Hey, just wanted to check on things." "I
    noticed a big deposit and wanted to make sure you had everything you needed."
    etc. For my side, I am mostly confused: why is this person calling me? I mostly
    say things like "yes yes I''m fine" and end the call quickly. Some wheels have
    started turning in Southern California, and I just hadn''t known it yet.'

    call me again, and we have no changes in our banking setup. For two years, the

    Surprise surprise, Alex calls me! I'm starting to realize banks get an alert when
    there are major changes in account balances. Regardless, I once again brush Alex
    off -- "everything is good thanks! bye!" -- and continue on with my life.

    And around the same time of the funding, we hire a Vice President of Finance.
    As he gets up to speed with our financial footing, he notices we have ~$35M sitting
    in cash in a Chase bank account. This is *obviously* not a smart thing to do,
    so he suggests some financial plans for how to better safeguard and utilize this
    mountain of cash.
  prefs: []

- en: As part of these plans, he suggests moving to Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). They're
    local to the Bay Area, he's worked with them before, and their bankers understand
    startups. It'll make accounts receivables, payables, payroll, etc. easier. To
    me, a bank is a bank is a bank, and if it helps make his job easier, I support
    his plan.
  prefs: []

    balance to SVB. I have to pay something like a $30 fee to wire $35M (inconsequential
    to the story, but amusing nonetheless). Someone calls me for verification -- not
    Alex -- and the wire processes. *Boom, we're done with Chase.* Or so I think.
  prefs: []

    sounds slightly agitated. I wasn't rude to him, but I was short with him. I switched
    banks, that's all there is to it. Thanks and goodbye. I never talk to Alex ever
    again. A bank is a bank is a bank, you put money in, you get money out, I don't
    understand why I would need to *talk to someone*.

    account with -- became a fast rising star in the area. He had opened a business
    account in a small suburb that grew from $20,000 to $35,000,000 in balances in
    just four years! Despite the business (my business) not engaging in higher-revenue
    activities with the bank, the opportunity this account represented to the small
    business wing of the small suburban branch stirred up some excitement. It was
    just a matter of time.
  prefs: []

    any prior warning, that account was *gone*. I used online banking to transfer
    the entirety of the balance to another bank. The small suburban branch viewed
    this as a *huge loss* and Alex came into work with some tough questions and no
    answers. I instantly recalled feeling that Alex was agitated when he called me
    the day after the transfer, and I now had an idea of why.
  prefs: []

    in the area" and said it with a noticably negative tone. I don't know what this

    study they used for this presentation: HashiCorp.'

    explain how that happens. To close an account, I had to do it in person at any
    local Chase branch. Startups are busy, the account balance in 2016 was $0, and
    so I just put it off. Well, a couple years passed, it was still open, and a few
    customers were actually sending payments to it.'

    our finance team realized that there was also fraud. For over a year, someone
    had been wiring thousands of dollars out every few weeks. We were short over $100,000
    due to fraud. The finance team immediately called Chase and reported the fraud,
    locked down the account, and Chase started an investigation.
  prefs: []

    balance to our actual business bank. With the fraud actively being handled by
    Chase and the finance team, I take on the task of closing the account. I immediately
    head to the nearest local Chase branch (once again a branch I've never been to
    before) and explain the situation.

    good. The branch manager explains that due to the actions taken to lock down the
    account for fraud, electronic transfers are unavailable. It doesn't matter that
    I'm provably the person who opened the account, electronic transfers are "impossible."

    money cash?" He says yes. The balance in the account is somewhere around $1M.'

    department, talking to this branch manager, and calling the Chase business phone
    line. We determine that instead of literal green cash, I can get a cashier''s
    check. But there is a major problem: the amount the cashier''s check is made out
    for has to be available *at that local branch* (or, whichever branch issues it).
    And, well, local branches I guess don''t usually have $1M cash lying around. Or,
    if they do, its not enough to cover other business activities for the day so they''re
    not willing to part with it.'

    be able to help me." He literally writes down a phone number on a piece of paper.
    This is all feeling so surreal. I call this number and its for a slightly larger
    branch a few miles down the road. He says "you're the HashiCorp guy right?" And
    I roll my eyes. My infamy in the area is still well known.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This manager is very helpful, if not a bit gruff. He explains to me that each
    local branch has some sort of performance metric based on inflows and outflows
    at the given branch. Therefore, funding a $1M cash withdrawal was not attractive
    to them. I'm learning a lot in a really condensed period of time at this point.
    I don't even know if what he's telling me is true, or legal, all I hear is "this
    is going to be hard to do if you want it all at once."

    is not happy, but he says he''ll call me back in 24 to 48 hours. True to his word,
    he calls me back the next day. He says that he had to coordinate to ensure his
    branch had the proper funding to satisfy this transaction, and that the funding
    would be available at a specific date a few days hence. He said I have to do the
    withdrawal *that day* because his branch will not hold that amount in cash for
    any longer.'

    funds somewhere with haste. I believe his exact words were "if you lose that check,
    I can't help you." Again, this was a one time event, and I don't know how true
    that all is, but it was said to me.
  prefs: []

    I tell the teller my name and there is a flicker of immediate recognition. The

    I never gave them the chance. I never told them what my business does or what
    I'd use the money for. I never talked to anyone (besides saying what I needed
    to get off the phone). This story isn't a cautionary tale about Chase, it is rather
    recounting my naivete as a young, first-time startup founder.
