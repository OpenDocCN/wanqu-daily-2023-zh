    company (Suggestr) in a particular industry (AI+ecommerce) while going through
    a particular batch (W22). The impression will be different for every founder,
    especially now after Covid, when the program is back to being in-person.

    a conveyor, pushing everyone through the same pipeline, which doesn''t allow it
    to give a decent value to each individual company. It’s hardly surprising given
    **a) a lot of companies, b) all at different stages, c) all in different industries.**
    At the same time, the same theory is given to everyone, and the partner, on average,
    is one for 20 companies. But now, let''s look individually at each component that
    makes up the value of any accelerator:'

    stages, and there is no dependency on each other in any way—no relationship or
    a sense of community is formed.

    ~60 companies in our group once, and for the rest of the 340 companies in our
    batch, I haven’t even seen them. YC tried to split the teams into even smaller
    groups, but due to the fact that everyone is relatively independent and doesn’t
    have much in common, neither mutual interest nor connection is built.

    to adapt, you will sleep on the calls or skip half of them. (We had the calls

    meet up in person. But, if you are not in SF or NY, expect very few people to
    show up. We met only 2-3 new companies at the local meet-ups in Singapore.

    omniscient brain. It is really good for searching for specific questions, and
    it does contain a lot of first-hand information that cannot be found anywhere
    else, but it’s not a tool for live communication, and since your questions are
    tied to your profile and are seen by everyone, it’s unlikely you will want to
    use it for particularly dumb or personal questions.

    you have a dev tool, or analytics SaaS, then there is a puddle of clients for
    you. But, you are not alone in that puddle. Again, due to the fact that there
    are not 20, but 400 companies, it will be difficult to sell even within the batch,
    because other members are already overloaded with unique offers from other YC
    companies.

    Bookface to find leads or ask YC community for an intro to the customers. It works,
    but again, depending on the industry and the person you ask.

    exchange with homies. YC does not have any industrial partners, and YC partners
    themselves will not do external intros to clients/investors for you! (Maybe investors,
    in rare cases, but under the table).

    to different people differently. In general, there is an evident focus on the
    very early stage without a product. The main theory and advice are about how to
    figure out what to do, how to build an MVP, how to launch, how to talk to customers,
    where to find the first 10 customers, how to raise the first money, and so on.
    Needless to say, for companies with tens or even hundreds of thousands in revenue
    it won’t be very valuable. In addition, all of it can be found publicly in the
    Startup School directory, Youtube, or other sources (in our case, we’ve covered
    it all in Entrepreneur First).

    time do not come close to it, in 90% of cases covering stories of successful success
    from the founders (which you can watch on Youtube if you want a boost of motivation).

    there are not so many of them and they’re difficult to book, secondly, the expertise
    of the partners is more generic, and thirdly, when everything is just working
    but slowly, you may not have specific questions or problems to ask about. In our
    case, we went through all the consultations with two tips: “send more emails (like
    really more)” and “don''t call your subscription revenue MRR because you don''t
    have MRR", that was it.'

    into their framework, and any attempts to go beyond the framework are quickly
    suppressed. In their picture of the world, you, the founders, should only build
    a product and talk to customers, everything else is superfluous and waste of time.
    Hiring is waste of time, paid advertising is waste of time, content is waste of
    time, talking to investors is waste of time, getting media coverage is waste of
    time.

    up. But in real life marketing and hype really matters, and when everyone does
    these things while you naively sit and code, they get an advantage in the market,
    and you get your cool product.'

    raise smarter and more, but to the fact that everyone needs to follow their simple
    framework, not try to shine too much, not try to choose the right words, wash
    off all the makeup, put on a gray uniform, and present dry facts—how much money
    customers already paid you, what the size of the market, if you count all the
    units you can sell, what you have actually built and what is working today. And
    this will always sound bad for anyone, it just can't sound good in the early days.
    And what actually works is storytelling, confident vision, committed revenue,
    and all these subtle things. It looks as if they are trying to make the selection
    process among 400 companies easier for the investors, and cover their own reputational
    risks, instead of trying to wrap each company in a beautiful wrapper and help
    it to raise easier.

    Undoubtedly, YC companies receive extra attention from investors and the very
    fact of their pre-selection by YC makes the deal hotter and increases its valuation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, now this trend is fading, and the valuations of YC startups do not
    go very far from the valuations of outside companies. Undoubtedly, a large number
    of companies in the batch and dilution of the YC brand work against it.

- en: Moreover, do not expect YC to guarantee that you will raise only from tier-1
    funds. The best funds make 10-15 investments in a batch maximum, therefore, all
    others go on the market, and raise from the same VC they were talking to even
    before YC.

- en: Now let’s talk about the Demo Day. According to rumors, good companies close
    the round a week before the demo day, or at least they get a lead, and at DD only
    get the follow-ons. (You can see the conflict between YC advice and reality).
    Why is it happening? High-quality funds do not need a demo day, their only job
    is to scout great startups, and of course, they will want to start a relationship
    earlier, rather than later, when the queue is already lined up. Demo day can attract
    only micro-funds and angels who do not have the resources to scout and who learn
    about companies on the demo day.

    you, if they haven't reached out yet it means they're not interested.

    If this is not the first money for the company, then it’s a spare change you won’t
    even notice.” Now, with a 500k deal, the amount is more substantial, but in turn,
    its terms are not super funder-friendly. Imho, the previous 125k deal was better
    for the founders since once the company gets accepted to YC it can raise easily
    a lot more money and on better terms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, in the reality of the current environment, getting 500k quickly,
    without extra overhead, can be a good deal that defines companies life or death,
    and a little extra dilution may be a reasonable price to pay.

    benefit, but give away 7% for it, then well...'

    now sitting in a very comfortable chair and can select the best startups and invest
    in them at a meager price, while standardizing all its value-add so much that
    it soon can be outsourced.

    us. In the hindsight, we got more out of it than the average company, as the constant
    comparison and growth benchmarking triggered us to look differently at our business
    and we decided to **wind up its operation right after the Demo Day**. YC teaches
    you one thing well—startups are all about growth, and if you didn’t grow today,
    it’s on you to find out how to grow tomorrow.'
