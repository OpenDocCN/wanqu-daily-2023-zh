- en: The [Elixir programming language](https://elixir-lang.org/) is well known in
    the world of software where uptime is critical to business success. The official
    description states, “Elixir is a dynamic, functional language for building scalable
    and maintainable applications.” This is a humble summary of the enormous power
    Elixir contains, which has saved businesses millions of dollars per year across
    industries.

    by Ben Marx, José Valim, Bruce Tate is an excellent guide to the strategic and
    technical reasons to use Elixir in your business. The very first chapter clearly
    illustrates the benefits.

- en: '***Steve**: We chose Elixir because we were looking for a system that was easy
    for programmers to understand and could take better advantage of our servers.
    I was intrigued at Elixir’s combination of friendly syntax, powerful metaprogramming
    features, and incorporation of the Actor model.*'

- en: '***Steve**: That’s pretty easy. When I started on the spam team, we had close
    to 1,400 servers running. When we converted several parts to Elixir, we reduced
    that by around 95%. One of the systems that ran on 200 Python servers now runs
    on four Elixir servers (it can actually run on two servers, but we felt that four
    provided more fault tolerance). The combined effect of better architecture and
    Elixir saved Pinterest over $2 million per year in server costs. In addition,
    the performance and reliability of the systems went up despite running on drastically
    less hardware. When our notifications system was running on Java, it was on 30
    c32.xl instances. When we switched over to Elixir, we could run on 15\. Despite
    running on less hardware, the response times dropped significantly, as did errors.*'

    and performance seems like fantasy. Elixir is able to demonstrate this incredible
    result because the language is built on top of Erlang, a platform designed for
    concurrent software that must stay online. Banking portals, e-commerce sites,
    and SaaS products are just a few examples, most business software today has this
    requirement. The story of Elixir improving a product while reducing costs repeats
    itself.

    [releasing a detailed technical blog post](https://medium.com/coryodaniel/from-erverless-to-elixir-48752db4d7bc)
    based on the enormous interest his tweet generated. The above example is not surprising
    to anyone who has worked on a complicated serverless system. The hosting costs
    quickly become unreasonable, and it may not be possible to run the code locally
    on your machine when making a change, adding days of expensive development time.
    Developers love Elixir for the excellent experience it provides when creating
    software, and the business loves how much more work gets done ahead of schedule.'

    and performance. All this is possible because Elixir, and the Erlang platform
    underneath, are fundamentally designed for always-online software with many users.
    When you use the right tool for the job, the benefits are clear.
