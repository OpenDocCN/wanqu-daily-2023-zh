- en: Weâ€™re a family of two parents and 5 children aged 5 to 19\. Weâ€™ve been on our
    unschooling journey for over 10 years now. There is no going back or no other
    way for us. The inefficiencies and stress of schools are just too much for us
    to bear.

- en: We do get tempted with going back to school and sometimes drool at private schools.
    We then figure the Â£3k a month it would cost (for 3 of the kids) is ridiculous.
    There are so many better ways to spend that kind of money.

    and I bring my laptop with me whenever I think there will be an opportunity for
    me to sit down for 1â€“3 hours to do some work. Often itâ€™s easier, cheaper and more
    efficient to work whilst I sit and wait for sessions to finish rather than going
    back home.

- en: The important thing to remember here is that our kids have opted in for all
    these activities. We only do what they are interested in. And this is what makes
    unschooling beautiful.
