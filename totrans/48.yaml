- en: '**I. By now, nearing 9 a.m. at Apple Park,** he’s long since gotten up and
    absorbed himself in the morning rituals of the modern CEO: email and exercise.
    Tim Cook takes pride in not hiding his email address, which is readily available
    on the search engine of your choice. In fact, Cook says, he finds the avalanche
    of unsolicited emails helpful. He rises at around 5 a.m. and reads through all
    of them. Customers tell him what they think and feel about Apple products, sometimes
    they tell him stories about their own lives, and this information becomes a source
    of inspiration. If you work for Cook, you will inevitably wake up one day, wherever
    you are, to find one of these emails forwarded to you.'

  zh: '**I. 现在，接近上午9点，在苹果园区，** 他早就起床并沉浸在现代CEO的早晨仪式中：电子邮件和锻炼。蒂姆·库克以不隐藏自己的电子邮件地址为荣，这在您选择的搜索引擎上很容易找到。事实上，库克说，他发现那些未经请求的电子邮件的大量很有帮助。他大约在早上5点起床并阅读所有这些邮件。客户告诉他们对苹果产品的看法和感受，有时候他们会告诉他们自己生活的故事，这些信息成为灵感的来源。如果你为库克工作，你迟早会有一天醒来，无论你在哪里，都会发现其中一封这样的电子邮件被转发给你。'
- en: And then, often before the sun has even risen, someone arrives to make him do
    what Cook describes as “things I would prefer not to do, that I could probably
    convince myself not to do.” (Weight training, mostly.) And then he heads here,
    to the corporate headquarters of the company Cook has led since 2011.

  zh: 然后，通常在太阳甚至升起之前，有人来让他做库克描述为“我宁愿不做的事情，我可能会说服自己不去做的事情。”（主要是重量训练。）然后他来到这里，来到自2011年以来一直领导的公司的总部。
- en: 'He is not a leader who is drawn to crisis or conflict, two climates his predecessor,
    Steve Jobs, seemed to at times thrive in. “I try not to let the urgent take over
    the day,” Cook says. Regular meetings, different standing engagements with different
    parts of the company. He likes to ask questions. “I’m curious, and I’m curious
    about how things work,” he says. He does this not to intimidate, though there
    is perhaps a standard, an expectation of those working for him, lurking there
    as well: “If something’s really shallow, you find that people can’t explain it
    very well.” Like Jobs once did, he sometimes takes meetings on the move, walking
    around the campus. Most days, he leaves the office at 6:30 or 7 p.m. The overall
    sensation he attempts to impart is one of normalcy, of proportion, despite the
    fact that most days, Apple, which employs about 165,000 people, is the most valuable
    company in the world. (As of this writing, it’s worth more than $2 trillion; at
    one moment last year, that number was $3 trillion, a figure roughly equal to the
    gross domestic product of the United Kingdom.)'

  zh: 他不是一个喜欢危机或冲突的领导者，这两种氛围似乎是他的前任史蒂夫·乔布斯有时候会蓬勃发展的。库克说：“我尽量不让紧急事件占据一天的时间。” 定期会议，与公司不同部门的不同常规约会。他喜欢提问。“我很好奇，我对事物如何运作很好奇，”他说。他这样做并不是为了恐吓，尽管也许有一种标准，一种对于为他工作的人的期望，潜伏在那里：“如果某事非常肤浅，你会发现人们无法很好地解释它。”
    像乔布斯曾经做过的那样，他有时会在移动中开会，走动在校园里。大多数时候，他在下午6:30或7点离开办公室。他试图传达的整体感觉是一种正常性，一种比例感，尽管大多数时候，拥有约165,000名员工的苹果公司是世界上最有价值的公司。
    （截至目前，它的价值超过2万亿美元；去年的某个时刻，这个数字是3万亿美元，大致相当于英国的国内生产总值。）
- en: Apple’s inventions—starting with 1976’s Apple I and 1977’s Apple II, and continuing
    through the iMac, the iPod, the iPhone, the iPad, the Apple Watch, and AirPods—have
    arguably done more to change the basic way that humans go through their day than
    those of any other company in the past 50 years. For these achievements, Jobs,
    who cofounded Apple and spearheaded the development of most of its signature products,
    is worshipped like a god, and Jonathan Ive, Apple’s erstwhile design head, is
    worshipped like a demigod. But it is Cook who has run the company since Jobs’s
    death, in 2011, Cook who has presided over the astronomical growth in the value
    of the stock, and Cook who is shaping the future of Apple today. It is his responsibility
    to protect what the company has already built while presiding over Apple’s next
    big thing. Lately, rumor has coalesced around that thing being a headset, perhaps
    called the Reality Pro, with capabilities for virtual and augmented reality. Rumor
    suggests this headset is imminent. (Cook will not, to be clear, confirm or deny
    the existence of such a thing to a journalist, though he will happily talk about
    the…*potential*…of such a device.) And yet Cook is, in the wealth of biographies
    and hagiography that has grown up around Apple since its founding, an enigma still.
    “He’s very hard to read,” says Eddy Cue, who has been at Apple since 1989 and
    now leads its services division. “If you’re looking to make your decision or your
    beliefs based on reading his facial expressions, you’re probably not going to
    be good at that. I always joke around with him that he’d be a great poker player,
    because he’d have four aces and no one would know.”

  zh: 苹果的发明——从1976年的Apple I和1977年的Apple II开始，一直延续到iMac、iPod、iPhone、iPad、Apple Watch和AirPods——可以说比过去50年中的任何其他公司更多地改变了人类日常生活的基本方式。由于这些成就，共同创立了苹果并主导了大部分标志性产品开发的乔布斯被崇拜如神，而苹果前设计负责人乔纳森·艾维则被崇拜如半神。但是自乔布斯于2011年去世以来，一直在管理公司的是库克，是他主持了股票价值的天文数字增长，是他正在塑造苹果的未来。他的责任是保护公司已经建立的东西，同时主持苹果的下一个重大项目。最近，有传言围绕着这个项目，可能是一款名为Reality
    Pro的头戴式设备，具有虚拟和增强现实功能。传言表明这款头戴式设备即将推出。（库克明确表示，不会向记者确认或否认这种设备的存在，尽管他乐意谈论这种设备的…*潜力*…。）然而，在苹果自成立以来形成的大量传记和圣人传记中，库克仍然是一个谜。自1989年加入苹果并现在领导其服务部门的埃迪·库表示：“他很难读懂。如果你试图根据他的面部表情做决定或形成信念，你可能做得不好。我总是和他开玩笑说他会是一名出色的扑克玩家，因为他手里有四张王牌，而没有人知道。”
