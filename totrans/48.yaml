    absorbed himself in the morning rituals of the modern CEO: email and exercise.
    Tim Cook takes pride in not hiding his email address, which is readily available
    on the search engine of your choice. In fact, Cook says, he finds the avalanche
    of unsolicited emails helpful. He rises at around 5 a.m. and reads through all
    of them. Customers tell him what they think and feel about Apple products, sometimes
    they tell him stories about their own lives, and this information becomes a source
    of inspiration. If you work for Cook, you will inevitably wake up one day, wherever
    you are, to find one of these emails forwarded to you.'

    what Cook describes as “things I would prefer not to do, that I could probably
    convince myself not to do.” (Weight training, mostly.) And then he heads here,
    to the corporate headquarters of the company Cook has led since 2011.

    Steve Jobs, seemed to at times thrive in. “I try not to let the urgent take over
    the day,” Cook says. Regular meetings, different standing engagements with different
    parts of the company. He likes to ask questions. “I’m curious, and I’m curious
    about how things work,” he says. He does this not to intimidate, though there
    is perhaps a standard, an expectation of those working for him, lurking there
    as well: “If something’s really shallow, you find that people can’t explain it
    very well.” Like Jobs once did, he sometimes takes meetings on the move, walking
    around the campus. Most days, he leaves the office at 6:30 or 7 p.m. The overall
    sensation he attempts to impart is one of normalcy, of proportion, despite the
    fact that most days, Apple, which employs about 165,000 people, is the most valuable
    company in the world. (As of this writing, it’s worth more than $2 trillion; at
    one moment last year, that number was $3 trillion, a figure roughly equal to the
    gross domestic product of the United Kingdom.)'

- en: Apple’s inventions—starting with 1976’s Apple I and 1977’s Apple II, and continuing
    through the iMac, the iPod, the iPhone, the iPad, the Apple Watch, and AirPods—have
    arguably done more to change the basic way that humans go through their day than
    those of any other company in the past 50 years. For these achievements, Jobs,
    who cofounded Apple and spearheaded the development of most of its signature products,
    is worshipped like a god, and Jonathan Ive, Apple’s erstwhile design head, is
    worshipped like a demigod. But it is Cook who has run the company since Jobs’s
    death, in 2011, Cook who has presided over the astronomical growth in the value
    of the stock, and Cook who is shaping the future of Apple today. It is his responsibility
    to protect what the company has already built while presiding over Apple’s next
    big thing. Lately, rumor has coalesced around that thing being a headset, perhaps
    called the Reality Pro, with capabilities for virtual and augmented reality. Rumor
    suggests this headset is imminent. (Cook will not, to be clear, confirm or deny
    the existence of such a thing to a journalist, though he will happily talk about
    the…*potential*…of such a device.) And yet Cook is, in the wealth of biographies
    and hagiography that has grown up around Apple since its founding, an enigma still.
    “He’s very hard to read,” says Eddy Cue, who has been at Apple since 1989 and
    now leads its services division. “If you’re looking to make your decision or your
    beliefs based on reading his facial expressions, you’re probably not going to
    be good at that. I always joke around with him that he’d be a great poker player,
    because he’d have four aces and no one would know.”
