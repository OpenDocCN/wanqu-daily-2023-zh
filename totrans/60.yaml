    quirky, quiet Altman would become so central to the Silicon Valley narrative,
    even if they were already among its most prominent names. Musk, for one, had other
    headaches. Tesla was [struggling](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-tesla-is-struggling-to-make-model-3-2017-10)
    to keep up with production goals of its Model 3 sedan and the stock was [tanking](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/01/tesla-q3-2017-earnings.html),
    threatening the company’s future.

    time, also opposed Musk’s takeover as did others at OpenAI. A power struggle ensued,

    According to tax documents, he added president to his title in 2018, in addition
    to being a director.

    said the reason for his departure was a conflict of interest. Tesla, which was
    developing its own artificial intelligence for autonomous driving, would be competing
    for talent with OpenAI.

    autonomous driving program.

    he gave at OpenAI’s offices at the time of his departure, which focused mainly
    on the potential conflict of interest, was not received well by most employees,
    who didn’t entirely buy the story.

    would continue to fund the organization, but Musk did not, according to people
    familiar with the matter. He had promised to donate roughly $1 billion over a
    period of years (he had already contributed $100 million), but his payments stopped
    after his departure, people familiar with the matter said. That left the nonprofit
    with no ability to pay the [astronomical](https://openai.com/research/ai-and-compute)
    fees associated with training AI models on supercomputers.

    of becoming a cutting edge AI company were going to go up. Google Brain’s “[transformer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9P_VAMyb-7k)”
    had blown open a new frontier, where AI could improve endlessly. But that meant
    feeding it endless data to train it — a costly endeavor.

    entity so that it could raise enough money to pay for the compute power necessary
    to pursue the most ambitious AI models. “We want to increase our ability to raise
    capital while still serving our mission, and no pre-existing legal structure we
    know of strikes the right balance,” the company wrote at the time. OpenAI said
    it was capping profits for investors, with any excess going to the original nonprofit.

    in the new for-profit entity, according to people familiar with the matter. Altman
    was already extremely wealthy, investing in several wildly successful tech startups,
    and didn’t need the money. The Information first [reported](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsoft-openai-inside-techs-hottest-romance?utm_source=ti_app&rc=nocdws)

    but he told people the project was not designed to make money. Eschewing any ownership
    interest would help him stay aligned with the original mission.  But that decision
    actually turned off some potential investors in OpenAI, who worried that Altman
    didn’t see upside in the project.

    from Microsoft, which could provide not just funding but infrastructure know-how.
    Together they built a supercomputer to train massive models that eventually created
    ChatGPT and the image generator DALL-E. The latest language model, GPT-4, has
    1 trillion parameters.

    to scramble to play catchup. Musk was furious, according to people familiar with
