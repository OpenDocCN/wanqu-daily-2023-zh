- en: But in 2018, there was no reason to think that either the impulsive Musk or
    quirky, quiet Altman would become so central to the Silicon Valley narrative,
    even if they were already among its most prominent names. Musk, for one, had other
    headaches. Tesla was [struggling](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-tesla-is-struggling-to-make-model-3-2017-10)
    to keep up with production goals of its Model 3 sedan and the stock was [tanking](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/01/tesla-q3-2017-earnings.html),
    threatening the company’s future.

  zh: 但是在2018年，没有理由认为冲动的马斯克或古怪安静的阿尔特曼会成为硅谷叙事的核心，即使他们已经是其中最知名的名字之一。马斯克本人也有其他烦恼。特斯拉正在[努力](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-tesla-is-struggling-to-make-model-3-2017-10)实现Model
    3轿车的生产目标，股价[下跌](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/01/tesla-q3-2017-earnings.html)，威胁着公司的未来。
- en: Greg Brockman, an OpenAI co-founder who was chief technology officer at that
    time, also opposed Musk’s takeover as did others at OpenAI. A power struggle ensued,
    according to people familiar with the matter.

  zh: OpenAI联合创始人、当时的首席技术官格雷格·布罗克曼也反对马斯克的接管，其他OpenAI的人也是如此。据知情人士透露，一场权力斗争随之而来。
- en: Altman, who also ran the powerful startup accelerator YCombinator, stepped in.
    According to tax documents, he added president to his title in 2018, in addition
    to being a director.

- en: Musk then stepped down from OpenAI’s board of directors. Publicly, he and OpenAI
    said the reason for his departure was a conflict of interest. Tesla, which was
    developing its own artificial intelligence for autonomous driving, would be competing
    for talent with OpenAI.

  zh: 马斯克随后从OpenAI的董事会辞职。公开来说，他和OpenAI表示他离开的原因是利益冲突。特斯拉正在开发自己的人工智能用于自动驾驶，将与OpenAI竞争人才。

- en: But few people at OpenAI believed Musk was leaving for that reason, and a speech
    he gave at OpenAI’s offices at the time of his departure, which focused mainly
    on the potential conflict of interest, was not received well by most employees,
    who didn’t entirely buy the story.

  zh: 但是在OpenAI，很少有人相信马斯克是因为那个原因离开的，他在离职时在OpenAI办公室发表的演讲主要集中在潜在的利益冲突上，并没有得到大多数员工的好评，他们并不完全相信这个故事。
- en: An OpenAI [announcement](https://openai.com/blog/openai-supporters) said Musk
    would continue to fund the organization, but Musk did not, according to people
    familiar with the matter. He had promised to donate roughly $1 billion over a
    period of years (he had already contributed $100 million), but his payments stopped
    after his departure, people familiar with the matter said. That left the nonprofit
    with no ability to pay the [astronomical](https://openai.com/research/ai-and-compute)

- en: That fall, it became even more apparent to some people at OpenAI that the costs
    of becoming a cutting edge AI company were going to go up. Google Brain’s “[transformer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9P_VAMyb-7k)”
    had blown open a new frontier, where AI could improve endlessly. But that meant
    feeding it endless data to train it — a costly endeavor.

    entity so that it could raise enough money to pay for the compute power necessary
    to pursue the most ambitious AI models. “We want to increase our ability to raise
    capital while still serving our mission, and no pre-existing legal structure we
    know of strikes the right balance,” the company wrote at the time. OpenAI said
    it was capping profits for investors, with any excess going to the original nonprofit.

    OpenAI表示，它正在为投资者设定利润上限，任何超额利润都将归原非营利组织所有。
- en: 'Altman also made an unusual decision for a tech boss: He would take no equity
    in the new for-profit entity, according to people familiar with the matter. Altman
    was already extremely wealthy, investing in several wildly successful tech startups,

- en: He also believed the company needed to become a business to continue its work,
    but he told people the project was not designed to make money. Eschewing any ownership
    interest would help him stay aligned with the original mission.  But that decision
    actually turned off some potential investors in OpenAI, who worried that Altman
    didn’t see upside in the project.

  zh: 他还相信公司需要成为一家企业才能继续其工作，但他告诉人们，这个项目并不是为了赚钱。放弃任何所有权利将有助于他与最初的使命保持一致。但这个决定实际上让一些潜在的OpenAI投资者感到失望，他们担心阿尔特曼没有看到该项目的上升空间。
- en: Less than six months later, OpenAI took [$1 billion](https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/22/microsoft-invests-1-billion-in-openai-in-new-multiyear-partnership/)
    from Microsoft, which could provide not just funding but infrastructure know-how.
