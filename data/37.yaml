    in the fall of 1988, and met Linus Torvalds, who was the other new Swedish speaking
    student in computer science that year. Toward the end of that first year, we had
    gotten access to a Unix server, and I accidentally found [Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet),
    the discussion system, by mistyping `rm` as `rn`, the Usenet reader. I told Linus
    about it and we spent way too much time exploring this.

  zh: 我在 1988 年秋季开始在赫尔辛基大学攻读计算机科学，那一年 Linus Torvalds 也是计算机科学系里另一位新的瑞典语系学生。在那第一年结束时，我们获得了一个
    Unix 服务器的访问权限，我无意中发现了 [Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet)，一个讨论系统，因为我将
    `rm` 打成了 `rn`，也就是 Usenet 阅读器。我告诉了 Linus，我们花了太多时间探索这个系统。
- en: After the first year, we both went away to do the mandatory military service,
    though in different places. We returned to our university studies in the fall
    of 1990, and both took the course on C and Unix programming, which included a
    fair bit of theory of the Unix kernel architecture as well. This led to us reading
    about other operating system kernels, such as [QNX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QNX)
    and [Plan 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs). Linus and I
    discussed with some enthusiasm how an operating system should be built correctly.
    We had all the overconfidence of 20-year-old second-year university students.
    Everyone is better off that this wasn't recorded for posterity.

    内核架构的理论知识。这让我们开始阅读其他操作系统内核的资料，比如 [QNX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QNX) 和 [Plan
    9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs)。Linus 和我热情地讨论着如何正确构建一个操作系统。我们当时都是
    20 岁大学二年级学生的自信。幸好这段对话没有被记录下来。

    from a local shop that assembled computers from parts. The PC had a 386 CPU, which
    was relatively fancy at that time, because Linus wanted to explore multitasking.
    Also, since he came from a [Sinclair QL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_QL)
    with a 32-bit Motorola 68008 CPU, he wanted a 32-bit CPU, and did not want to
    step down to a 16-bit one, so a 286 was not an option. Linus's first PC had a
    whopping 4 megabytes of RAM and a hard drive.

    CPU 的 [Sinclair QL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_QL)，他想要一颗 32 位 CPU，不想退步到
    16 位，所以 286 不是一个选择。Linus 的第一台 PC 配备了惊人的 4 兆字节的内存和一个硬盘。

    day he showed me a program that did multitasking. One task or thread would write
    a stream of the letter "A" on the screen, the other "B"; the context switches
    were visually obvious when the stream of As became Bs. This was the first version
    of what would later become known as the Linux kernel.

- en: Linus would later expand the program, and write most of it in C. During this
    time, late spring of 1991, I wrote an implementation of the C [`sprintf()`](https://linux.die.net/man/3/sprintf)
    function for him, as he hadn't yet learned how to write functions with variable
    argument lists. I wanted to spare him the pain of having a different function
    for every type of value to write out. The core of this code is still in the kernel,
    [as `snprintf()`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.3-rc6/source/lib/vsprintf.c#L2911).

- en: As time went on, Linus made his fledgling kernel better and kept implementing
    new things. After a while, he had drivers for the keyboard and the serial port,
    emulation of [VT100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100) terminal escape sequences
    for the screen, and could use it to dial via a modem to the university to read
    Usenet from home. Science fiction! One day, Linus accidentally attempted to use
    his hard drive to dial the university, resulting in his master boot sector starting
    with ["ATDT"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayes_AT_command_set) and the university
    modem-pool phone number. After recovering from this, he implemented file permissions
    in his kernel.

    in the `comp.os.minix` newsgroup. This included the phrase "<q>I'm doing a (free)
    operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu)</q>".
    Such humility. The system was initially called Freax. A few weeks later, Linus
    asked Ari Lemmke, one of the administrators of `ftp.funet.fi`, to do an upload
    of the first tar archive. Ari chose the name Linux. The initial version still
    contains the original name embedded in [one of the source files](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/0.01/source/kernel/Makefile).

    Lemmke上传第一个tar归档文件。Ari选择了名字Linux。初始版本仍然在[一个源文件中包含原始名称](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/0.01/source/kernel/Makefile)。
- en: 'During this time, people were interested in trying out this new thing, so Linus
    needed to provide an installation method and instructions. Since he only had one
    PC, he came to visit to install it on mine. Since his computer had been used to
    develop Linux, which had simply grown on top of his Minix installation, it had
    never actually been installed before. Thus, mine was the first PC where Linux
    was ever installed. While this was happening, I was taking a nap, and I recommend
    this method of installing Linux: napping, while Linus does the hard work.'

- en: The first releases of Linux used a license that forbade commercial use. Some
    of the early contributors suggested a change to a free-software license. In the
    fall of 1991, Richard Stallman visited Finland and I took Linus to a talk given

    Linus to choose the GNU GPL license instead, in early 1992.

    for portability. Its speed does not matter.) A couple of years later, he spent

    code was occasionally a little rough, having been written from scratch. At one
    point, Linux would send some broken packets that took down all of the Sun machines
