    leverage different fonts and background palettes, for example. On a case-by-case
    basis, Substack has worked with some of its largest publications to create more
    extensive, elaborate custom themes. For example, visitors to The Free Press are

    opting to build a solution of its own. Beyond economic considerations, I suspect
    part of the rationale would have related to brand control. Indeed, this was a
    key consideration when we thought about moving The Generalist back to Substack.
    Though we’ve started with the platform’s default aesthetic as we get back up to

- en: The more compelling Substack’s toolkit becomes, the more creators are likely
    to hop aboard. **The platform can also take steps to lower the barrier to creation
    – perhaps with the help of AI.** As outlined in “[Endless Media](https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/endless-media),”
    generative AI engines like Midjourney and ChatGPT are fundamentally disrupting
    how we create content, making it considerably easier to conjure compelling imagery
    and passable written text.

  zh: 随着Substack工具包变得越来越引人注目，越来越多的创作者可能会加入。**该平台还可以采取措施降低创作门槛 - 也许借助人工智能的帮助**。正如在“[无尽媒体](https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/endless-media)”中所概述的那样，Midjourney和ChatGPT等生成式人工智能引擎正在从根本上颠覆我们创作内容的方式，使得创作引人入胜的图像和可接受的文字变得更加容易。
- en: There are so many ways Substack could seek to benefit from these innovations.
    For example, it could automatically generate summaries of long articles for writers
    to include at the top of a piece – like our actionable insights. With the help
    of voice-skinning platforms, it could upgrade its read-aloud functionality to
    support custom audio; readers would hear articles in the author’s voice. It could
    even take a page from [Lex](https://lex.page/), an AI-powered word processor,
    augmenting its current editor to help publishers work through writer’s block or
    accelerate their process. Fittingly, Lex was created by the newsletter network,
    [Every](https://every.to/), which a former Substack employee co-founded.

- en: 'Substack is awake to the opportunity. One writer spoke about a closed beta
    test that made it easier to generate headline images using AI; Substack confirmed
    that it was running such an experiment. It’s a test in line with the platform’s
    ethos: it’s possible to manifest an apposite image using Midjourney but not effortless,
    requiring careful prompting. Though the details of Substack’s test have not been
    disclosed, it would make sense for the company to streamline this process, providing
    prompt guidance. Just as Substack made collecting subscriptions a matter of a
    few clicks, it may do the same for creating media assets.'

  zh: Substack已经意识到这个机会。一位作家谈到了一个闭门测试，通过使用人工智能更容易生成标题图像；Substack证实正在进行这样的实验。这是符合该平台理念的一项测试：使用Midjourney可以制作一个恰当的图像，但并不轻松，需要仔细的提示。尽管Substack的测试细节尚未披露，但公司简化这一过程并提供及时指导是有道理的。就像Substack让收集订阅成为几次点击的事情一样，它可能也会为创建媒体资产做同样的事情。

    media’s great unbundling, jailbreaking writers from traditional publishers and
    giving them the tools to succeed. However, it does fundamentally, well, ***bundle***

    on Substack was about *The Sun*. Announcing their new platform in July 2017, Chris
    Best and Hamish McKenzie detailed how the New York newspaper pioneered media’s
    advertising model in 1833 – five years before Moses Beach took over. In the view
    of Substack’s founders, by doing so, The Sun initiated the media industry’s gradual
    slide toward dishonesty and superficiality.
