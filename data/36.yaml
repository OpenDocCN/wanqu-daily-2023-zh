- en: About a year ago, Ben found out that one of his friends had quietly started
    to work multiple jobs at the same time. The idea had become popular during the
    COVID-19 pandemic, when working from home became normalized, making the scheme
    easier to pull off. A community of multi-job hustlers, in fact, had come together
    online, referring to themselves as the “overemployed.”

  zh: 大约一年前，本发现他的一个朋友悄悄开始同时从事多份工作。这个想法在COVID-19大流行期间变得流行起来，当时在家工作变得正常化，使得这种计划更容易实施。事实上，一个多工作的社区在线聚集在一起，他们自称为“过度就业者”。
- en: The idea excited Ben, who lives in Toronto and asked that Motherboard not use
    his real name, but he didn’t think it was possible for someone like him to pull
    it off. He helps financial technology companies market new products; the job involves
    creating reports, storyboards, and presentations, all of which involve writing.
    There was “no way,” he said, that he could have done his job two times over on
    his own.

  zh: 这个想法让居住在多伦多的本兴奋不已，他要求Motherboard不要使用他的真名，但他认为像他这样的人不可能做到。他帮助金融科技公司推广新产品；这项工作涉及创建报告、故事板和演示文稿，所有这些都涉及写作。他说，“绝对不可能”，他自己无法完成两份工作。
- en: Then, last year, he started to hear more and more about ChatGPT, an artificial
    intelligence chatbot developed by the research lab OpenAI. Soon enough, he was
    trying to figure out how to use it to do his job faster and more efficiently,
    and what had been a time-consuming job became much easier. ("Not a little bit
    more easy,” he said, “like, way easier.") That alone didn’t make him unique in
    the marketing world. Everyone he knew was using ChatGPT at work, he said. But
    he started to wonder whether he could pull off a second job. Then, this year,
    he took the plunge, a decision he attributes to his new favorite online robot
    toy.

    has led to growing concerns about AI’s potential effects on the international
    job market—specifically, the percentage of jobs that could be automated away,
    replaced by a well-oiled army of chatbots. But for a small cohort of fast-thinking
    and occasionally devious go-getters, AI technology has turned into an opportunity
    not to be feared but exploited, with their employers apparently none the wiser.

    losing their jobs. For clarity, Motherboard in some cases assigned people aliases
    in order to differentiate them, though we verified each of their identities. Some,
    like Ben, were drawn into the overemployed community as a result of ChatGPT. Others
    who were already working multiple jobs have used recent advancements in AI to
    turbocharge their situation, like one Ohio-based technology worker who upped his
    number of jobs from two to four after he started to integrate ChatGPT into his
    work process. “I think five would probably just be overkill,” he said.

- en: When one of Ben’s bosses, for example, now asks him to create a story for an
    upcoming product release, he will explain the context and provide a template to
    ChatGPT, which then creates an outline for him and helps fill out the sections.
    The AI chatbot knows Ben’s title and the parameters of his duties and has become
    even better at understanding the context since the launch of GPT-4, the latest
    edition, he said. “I can just tell it to create a story,” said Ben, “and it just
    does it for me, based off the context that I gave it.” Ben still needs to verify
    the information—”sometimes it gets stuff wrong, which is totally normal,” he said—but
    the adjustments are relatively “minor” and easy to fix.

- en: At the FAANG company, he was able to outsource written tasks to AI tools, like
    writing a memo to defend and justify a business decision. In such a case, he’d
    input the relevant facts and parameters into an AI chatbot, which would cohesively
    lay them out more quickly than he ever could. Additionally, he’d use it to lay
    out directions for engineers (“It allows you to take, basically, a sentence and
    expand it out into a paragraph”); and create a “foundation” when coding. The ChatGPT-created
    code “oftentimes” would work perfectly, he said, but the errors could be identified
    and resolved easily enough, he said.

    “I can create macros, but it takes me an hour, two hours, plus, to write the code,
    test it, make sure everything's working,” he said. By comparison, with ChatGPT,
    he can provide the parameters and it’ll “spit something out” that he can update
    and tweak to his specifications. The process can allow him to cram what is traditionally
    a “two-week long process” into a few hours.  (He says he avoids providing ChatGPT

    probably aren't as good at writing things as most other people,” Daniel said.
    He included himself in that critique of his own industry, but said it’s no longer
    a problem, as he can plug the key points into ChatGPT and ask the AI assistant
