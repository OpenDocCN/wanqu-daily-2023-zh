    business world, I didn''t think much about bank choice. I figured: you put money
    in, you take money out, they''re all the same. I also figured a local branch of
    a global bank is just a fungible tentacle of the giant banking machine, so also...
    who cares. Both incorrect assumptions, but let''s relive and rediscover the effect
    of these assumptions as I did.'

    any prior warning, that account was *gone*. I used online banking to transfer
    the entirety of the balance to another bank. The small suburban branch viewed

  zh: 几天后，我走进分行（我没有雇佣私人保安）。我告诉出纳我的名字，立即有一丝认可之情。出纳引导我到一个小隔间，账户成功关闭，我拿到了一张100万美元的银行支票，然后走出了门。

  zh: 我与Chase的企业银行关系，终于，告一段落。
- en: I want to make it clear that Chase could've been an excellent banking partner.
    I never gave them the chance. I never told them what my business does or what
    I'd use the money for. I never talked to anyone (besides saying what I needed
    to get off the phone). This story isn't a cautionary tale about Chase, it is rather
    recounting my naivete as a young, first-time startup founder.

  zh: 我想要明确的是，Chase本可以成为一个出色的银行合作伙伴。我从未给他们机会。我从未告诉他们我的企业做什么或者我会用这笔钱做什么。我从未与任何人交谈过（除了说我需要挂断电话）。这个故事并不是关于Chase的警示故事，而是在我年轻时作为第一次创业者的天真经历。

  zh: 足够的时间已经过去，员工轮换频繁，以至于我在洛杉矶地区的任何一家大通银行分支机构都不再被认出。
- en: I look back on these events and there are many places I cringe. At the same
    time, I can't imagine making different choices because I was acting in good faith
    at all times with the knowledge I had. I think the choices I made were reasonable
    for any new founder, and I know many founders who have made similar choices.

  zh: 回顾这些事件，有很多地方让我感到尴尬。与此同时，我无法想象做出不同选择，因为我始终本着诚信的原则，根据我所掌握的知识做出了决定。我认为我所做的选择对于任何新创始人来说都是合理的，我知道许多创始人也曾做出类似的选择。
- en: Ultimately, there was no long term negative impact of the events that transpired
    (except maybe for Alex, but I truly don't know) and I can now look back on it
    with amusement.
