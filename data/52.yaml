- en: 'The rapid rise of remote work over the last two years has rippled through society
    and the economy in a variety of ways. Amid many other negative social disruptions
    from the pandemic, there has been one positive change: remote work has provided
    some individuals and families with more work-related flexibility and time with
    family. For a variety of reasons, it is plausible that this flexibility and time
    may have been one factor that has increased birth rates over the pandemic for
    wealthier or more educated women. In this analysis, we provide empirical evidence
    suggesting that this is the case. While the long-running decline of fertility
    rates across the developed world makes it difficult to be optimistic overall about
    the future trajectory of births, the rise of remote work is one factor that seems
    likely to help push in the other direction, at least in some subgroups of the
    population. Given the importance of birth rates for demographic change, economic
    growth, and much much more, this is an important issue.'

  zh: 过去两年远程工作的迅速崛起在社会和经济中产生了各种影响。在疫情带来的许多其他负面社会扰乱中，有一个积极的变化：远程工作为一些个人和家庭提供了更多与家人在一起的工作灵活性和时间。出于各种原因，可以认为这种灵活性和时间可能是导致疫情期间富裕或受教育程度较高的女性生育率增加的一个因素。在这项分析中，我们提供了实证证据表明这是事实。尽管发达世界长期以来生育率的下降使人们难以对未来的出生率走势持乐观态度，但远程工作的崛起似乎是一个可能有助于推动另一方向的因素，至少在人口的某些亚群中是如此。鉴于出生率对人口变化、经济增长等方面的重要性，这是一个重要问题。
- en: To begin, it is useful to understand how remote work has provided greater flexibility
    and more free time. In the U.S., individuals save on average just under an hour
    of commuting time every day they work from home. In addition to this added leisure
    and work time, this allows them to spend more time with their families, ability
    to do more household chores, and generally contributing more to household production.
    Early data suggests that workers are spending 11.1 percent of their saved commute
    time on childcare, and 15.5 percent on housework. Among those living with children,
    the share spent on childcare rose to 18.2 percent, which is consistent with pre-pandemic
    data showing that mothers and fathers who work remotely spend substantially more
    time with their children on days they work from home. Other research has shown
    that time spent on parental care of their own children is associated with more
    positive reports of subjective well-being; that is, people tend to derive satisfaction
    and happiness from being with their own children.

  zh: 首先，了解远程工作如何提供更大的灵活性和更多的空闲时间是很有用的。在美国，每天在家工作的人平均节省了将近一小时的通勤时间。除了这增加的休闲和工作时间外，这使他们能够花更多时间与家人在一起，做更多家务，总体上为家庭生产做出更多贡献。早期数据表明，工作者将他们节省的通勤时间的11.1％用于照顾儿童，15.5％用于家务。在与儿童同住的人中，用于照顾儿童的时间比例提高到了18.2％，这与疫情前的数据一致，显示远程工作的母亲和父亲在在家工作的日子里与子女在一起的时间明显增加。其他研究表明，父母亲自照顾自己的孩子所花费的时间与主观幸福感更为积极相关；也就是说，人们从与自己的孩子在一起中获得满足感和幸福感。
- en: In addition, remote work provides some workers an added flexibility about not
    just *where* to work, but also *when*. This flexibility allows parents to not
    just have more time for childcare overall, but also more control over how they
    spend that time, making it easier to contribute to the sometimes inflexible schedules
    that parenting can require. Indeed, in pre-pandemic data, the number one reason
    parents stated they worked from home was “to coordinate their work schedule with
    their personal or family needs.”

  zh: 此外，远程工作为一些工作者提供了不仅是*在哪里*工作，而且*何时*工作的额外灵活性。这种灵活性不仅让父母们在整体上有更多时间照顾孩子，还让他们更有控制权决定如何利用这段时间，使得更容易适应育儿可能需要的有时不太灵活的时间表。事实上，在疫情前的数据中，父母们表示他们在家工作的主要原因是“协调工作时间与个人或家庭需求”。
- en: Overall, time-use patterns both pre- and post-pandemic make it plausible that
    remote work has made being a parent easier both for the remote parent, who can
    now help more, and the non-remote parent, who now has more help. There is some
    data that suggests this does indeed lead to higher birth rates. First, on the
    suggestive side, Bailey, Currie, and Schwandt find that increases in post-pandemic
    birth rates were concentrated among the college educated, whom they note, “saw
    drastic reductions in the opportunity cost of having a child, when they were able
    to work from home and work schedules became more flexible.” Somewhat more direct
    evidence can be found in Billari, Giuntella, and Stella (2019) who find that expanded
    broadband access in Germany pre-pandemic increased birth rates among more educated
    women. But altogether, the intuitive case for how remote work might support fertility
    is clear, and there is some suggestive evidence that the evidence remains fairly
    indirect.

  zh: 总体而言，疫情前后的时间利用模式使得远程工作让作为父母的生活更加便利，无论是远程工作的父母，他们现在可以提供更多帮助，还是非远程工作的父母，他们现在得到了更多帮助。有一些数据表明这确实导致了更高的出生率。首先，在暗示方面，贝利、柯里和施万特发现，疫情后出生率的增加主要集中在受过大学教育的人群中，他们指出，“当他们能够在家工作并且工作时间更加灵活时，生育子女的机会成本大幅降低。”在比利亚里、朱恩特拉和斯特拉（2019）的研究中可以找到更直接的证据，他们发现德国疫情前扩大的宽带接入增加了受过更高教育的女性的生育率。但总体而言，远程工作如何支持生育的直观案例是清晰的，而且有一些暗示性证据表明证据仍然相当间接。
- en: We add to this literature using two waves of a survey of the Demographic Intelligence
    Family Survey (DIFS-5 and DIFS-6) conducted in April and September 2022, respectively.
    This biannual survey developed by the consulting firm Demographic Intelligence
    to survey family and fertility dispositions samples 3,000 U.S. females ages 18-44\.
    The survey is designed specifically to assess reproductive intentions and fertility
    outlook, hence its focus on females of reproductive age—that is, people who may
    plausibly have more children. EIG assisted in survey instrument design for DIFS-6
    and provided some of the funding for the survey, and DIFS-5 already included a
    remote work question. Respondents were weighted to match the June 2020 CPS by
    age, race, prior birth history, income, and state. Because the survey does not
    sample men, it specifically explores how remote work may be impacting the lives
    and family dispositions of American women. Because DIFS has been operating for
    several years, we are able to ensure that our baseline results for fertility intention
    questions are not skewed vs. prior waves, and we have access to a rich set of
    control variables covering many elements of women’s lives such as impacts on fertility
    intentions, desires, ideals, recent changes in plans, and broader attitudes or
    dispositions. The data also provides numerous detailed demographic and socioeconomic
    information, allowing us to control for a broad set of other factors.

  zh: 我们通过对2022年4月和9月分别进行的两轮人口智能家庭调查（DIFS-5和DIFS-6）的调查，为这一领域增加了一些文献。这是由咨询公司人口智能开发的半年度调查，样本包括3,000名年龄在18-44岁的美国女性。该调查专门设计用于评估生育意向和生育前景，因此其重点是生育年龄的女性，即可能有更多子女的人群。EIG协助设计了DIFS-6的调查工具，并为调查提供了部分资金，而DIFS-5已经包含了一个远程工作问题。受访者根据年龄、种族、先前生育史、收入和州进行了加权。由于调查没有对男性进行抽样，因此它专门探讨了远程工作如何影响美国女性的生活和家庭倾向。由于DIFS已经运作了几年，我们能够确保我们对生育意向问题的基线结果与先前波次不偏斜，并且我们可以访问一个涵盖许多女性生活方面的控制变量集，如对生育意向、愿望、理想、最近计划变化以及更广泛的态度或倾向的影响。数据还提供了许多详细的人口统计和社会经济信息，使我们能够控制一系列其他因素。
- en: First, in terms of family formation, after controlling for a variety of factors
    like age, race, education, relationship status, prior number of children, and
    recent changes in financial health, we find that currently unmarried remote workers
    were significantly more likely to plan on getting married in the next year. The
    effect is quite large and robust to a range of alternative control variables.
    One speculative explanation for this effect is that remote workers now have higher
    migration rates than other workers, according to data from the American Community
    Survey; thus, remote work may have enabled people interested in marriage to relocate
    closer to a potential spouse. In other words, remote work may have helped alleviate
    the “[two body problem](https://research.upjohn.org/up_workingpapers/346/).”

  zh: 首先，在家庭形成方面，在控制年龄、种族、教育、关系状况、先前子女数量和最近财务状况变化等各种因素后，我们发现，目前未婚的远程工作者明显更有可能计划在未来一年内结婚。这种影响效应非常大，并且对一系列替代控制变量具有稳健性。对于这种效应的一个推测性解释是，根据美国人口普查数据，远程工作者现在具有比其他工作者更高的迁移率；因此，远程工作可能已经帮助那些有意结婚的人搬迁到潜在配偶附近。换句话说，远程工作可能已经帮助缓解了“[两体问题](https://research.upjohn.org/up_workingpapers/346/)”。
- en: Next, we assess whether women are pregnant or trying to become pregnant. This
    question is a good indicator of very near-term fertility outlooks, since respondents
    generally have a pretty clear and stable idea whether they are pregnant or trying
    to conceive, or not. When looking directly at the impact of remote work on this
    variable with the same controls, we find that remote workers are indeed more likely
    to be pregnant or trying; however, the difference is not statistically significant.

  zh: 接下来，我们评估女性是否怀孕或试图怀孕。这个问题是非常接近短期生育前景的一个很好的指标，因为受访者通常对自己是否怀孕或试图怀孕有一个相当清晰和稳定的想法。当直接观察远程工作对这一变量的影响时，我们发现，即使在相同的控制条件下，远程工作者确实更有可能怀孕或试图怀孕；然而，这种差异并不具有统计学意义。
- en: When we focus on the subset of workers who are doing relatively well, we see
    a larger and more statistically significant impact of remote work on fertility.
    Indeed, the association of remote work with likelihood of near-term pregnancy
    effort appears to increase monotonically with how self-reported household financial
    conditions have changed over the past year. Women whose household finances have
    gotten “much better” in the past year are more than 10 percentage points more
    likely to report being pregnant or trying to be so if they are remote, whereas
    for women with stable or deteriorating financial situations, there’s no difference
    between remote and non-remote. Remote work seems to help women in improving circumstances
    to capitalize on those improvements and convert financial success into family
    life.

  zh: 当我们关注相对情况较好的工作者子集时，我们发现远程工作对生育率的影响更大且具有更显著的统计意义。事实上，远程工作与近期怀孕努力的可能性的关联似乎随着过去一年中自我报告的家庭财务状况的变化而单调增加。在过去一年中家庭财务状况“好转”的女性如果进行远程工作，报告怀孕或试图怀孕的可能性要高出10个百分点以上，而对于家庭财务状况稳定或恶化的女性，远程和非远程之间没有区别。远程工作似乎帮助处于改善环境中的女性利用这些改善并将财务成功转化为家庭生活。
- en: Next, we turn to longer-term intentions. In particular, we look at the subsample
    of women who said that their *ideal* number of children was higher than their
    *actual current number* of children; that is, we analyze *intentions to have more
    children* exclusively among women who *say they would ideally like to have more
    children*. In other words, we analyze how remote work is associated with women
    having realistic intentions to achieve their ideal family size. We consider women
    who believe their ideal family size is attainable and thus intend to reach it,
    since intending *not* to reach family-size goals amounts to a foreshortening of
    family goals that are important to many people.

  zh: 接下来，我们转向长期意图。特别是，我们关注那些表示他们的*理想*孩子数量高于*当前实际孩子数量*的女性子样本；也就是说，我们专门分析*想要更多孩子的意愿*，仅限于*表示他们理想情况下想要更多孩子*的女性。换句话说，我们分析远程工作如何与女性拥有实现理想家庭规模的现实意图相关联。我们考虑那些认为他们的理想家庭规模是可以实现的，并因此打算实现它的女性，因为打算*不*实现家庭规模目标相当于缩短了许多人重要的家庭目标。
- en: In general, we find that remote work increases intentions to have more children
    by about five percentage points, though the effect is not quite statistically
    significant; however, segmenting our results by age yields striking differences.
    Unsurprisingly, remote work possibly has a negative effect on the fertility intentions
    of women under age 25, given that many women prefer not to begin childbearing
    at those ages. For women ages 25 to 34, remote work seems to have no effect. But
    for women over age 35 (and especially over age 39) those with remote work have
    much higher fertility intentions. In other words, remote work doesn’t necessarily
    trigger women to *initiate* childbearing, but it may help older women balance
    the competing demands of work and family and thereby to achieve their family goals.

  zh: 总的来说，我们发现远程工作会使想要更多孩子的意愿增加约五个百分点，尽管效果并不完全具有统计学意义；然而，根据年龄对我们的结果进行分段会产生显著差异。毫不奇怪，远程工作可能对25岁以下的女性的生育意愿产生负面影响，因为许多女性不愿在这个年龄开始生育。对于25至34岁的女性，远程工作似乎没有影响。但对于35岁以上的女性（尤其是39岁以上的女性），那些进行远程工作的女性具有更高的生育意愿。换句话说，远程工作不一定会促使女性*开始*生育，但它可能帮助年长的女性平衡工作和家庭之间的竞争需求，从而实现他们的家庭目标。
- en: Likewise, when we segment our sample by number of prior live births, we find
    that remote work has the biggest effect for women who already have several children.
    Remote work had no effect on the fertility intentions of women who have no or
    one child. But for women with two or more children, and especially working women
    with four or more children, remote work is associated with greater intentions
    to have more children. Here again we see that remote work may not do much to help
    women launch their family life at first, but it can help working mothers reach
    their ideal family size.

- en: 'Finally, we also asked women to assess their family outcomes: did they have
    the family life they always dreamed of; did they not have it yet but were on their
    way; or did they feel their family size goal would never be obtained? We find

- en: Overall we see the impact of remote work on women’s intentions for family formation
    and the desire to have children. While remote work appears to have the biggest
    positive impact on older women who already have children, the clear positive impact
    on marriage rates suggests the potential for longer-run impacts—including changed
    fertility rates—on younger women. While the evidence is early and far from conclusive,
    we believe this research makes the case for the hypothesis that elevated levels
    of remote work during COVID made a positive contribution to the U.S. and potentially
    other developed countries’ fertility rates. Moreover, we believe this evidence
    is suggestive that the “return to the office” may contribute to falling birth
    rates, and that governments interested in supporting marriage and implementing
    pro-natal policies may be interested in considering how flexible work arrangements
    can be supported and encouraged.

  zh: 总体而言，我们看到远程工作对女性的家庭形成意愿和生育欲望的影响。虽然远程工作似乎对已经有孩子的年长女性产生了最大的积极影响，但婚姻率的明显正面影响表明了对年轻女性的生育率等长期影响的潜力。虽然证据尚早且远非定论，但我们认为这项研究支持了这样一个假设：COVID期间远程工作水平的提高对美国和其他发达国家的生育率产生了积极贡献。此外，我们认为这一证据表明“回到办公室”可能会导致出生率下降，对于支持婚姻并实施促进生育政策的政府可能有兴趣考虑如何支持和鼓励灵活的工作安排。
