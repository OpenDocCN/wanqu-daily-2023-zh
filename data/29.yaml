- en: On October 12, 1997, John Denver, popular folk singer and amateur pilot, at
    the controls of a newly-purchased experimental aircraft, died after crashing into
    Monterey Bay, in California. He died in an aircraft that had already done its
    best to kill two previous pilots, an aircraft with a human interface flaw so fundamental,
    so profound, that it finally managed to kill.

  zh: 1997年10月12日，流行民谣歌手和业余飞行员约翰·丹佛（John Denver），驾驶一架新购买的实验飞机，坠毁在加利福尼亚的蒙特利湾，不幸身亡。他死在一架已经试图杀死两名前驾驶员的飞机上，一架存在着如此根本、深刻的人机界面缺陷的飞机，最终成功地造成了死亡。
- en: The Long EZ is a kit aircraft designed by Burt Rutan, one of the world's greatest
    aerospace designers. Rutan was responsible for the Voyager, the first aircraft
    to circumnavigate the globe without refueling. He is currently working on a reusable
    spacecraft for commercial and tourist operations that can fly into space in the
    morning, be checked out and refueled over lunch, and fly again that very afternoon.
    One of his Long EZ planes, similar to John Denver's, holds the altitude record
    for conventional aircraft. It is a brilliant design, and is well respected in
    the aviation community.

  zh: 长EZ是由伯特·鲁坦设计的套件飞机，他是世界上最伟大的航空航天设计师之一。鲁坦负责设计了环球无加油飞行的第一架飞机“航海家”。他目前正在研发一种可重复使用的太空飞船，用于商业和旅游运营，可以在早上飞入太空，中午检查和加油，然后在当天下午再次飞行。他的一架类似约翰·丹佛的长EZ飞机保持着常规飞机的高度记录。这是一个出色的设计，在航空界中备受尊重。
- en: Experimental aircraft kits, however, need not be built as the designer intended.
    Indeed, the flaws that led to Denver's death were the work of the builder, and
    had nothing to do with Burt Rutan. These flaws led from the builder's sincere
    desire to improve on Rutan's work, a goal that could actually be said to have
    been accomplished from an engineering perspective, even if it did kill the pilot.

    but if you look back to the history of the motorcar, you can see quite a contrast
    with aviation. The car companies required government intervention before adding,
    while still kicking and screaming, such esoteric safety equipment as headlights,
    windshield wipers, and seat belts. The aviation community, on the contrary, from
    the beginning made safety their primary goal.

    can take several minutes to "pull over," during which time that fire can be pouring
    inky black smoke into the cockpit, blinding the pilot, making a crash inevitable.
    As a result, aircraft have fuel shutoff valves in the cockpit. Flip the valve
    and find a nice, friendly field somewhere below where you can safely land your

- en: 'John Denver''s aircraft had a fuel selection valve with only three positions:
    Off, Left, and Right. Burt Rutan''s design called for that valve to be placed
    on the front panel of the aircraft, making it easy to switch among the options.
    The builder of the aircraft, however, elected to place the valve back behind the
    pilot''s left shoulder. He did so with the best of intentions. By placing the
    valve behind the pilot''s compartment, on the other side of the back firewall,
    with only a long rod leading to the handle behind the pilot''s left shoulder,
    he avoided running the gas lines through the passenger compartment, eliminating
    any possibility of a gasline rupture occuring inside the compartment.'

  zh: 约翰·丹佛的飞机的燃油选择阀只有三个位置：关闭、左、右。伯特·鲁坦的设计要求将该阀门放在飞机的前面板上，使其易于在选项之间切换。然而，飞机的制造者选择将阀门放在飞行员左肩后面。他这样做是出于最好的意图。通过将阀门放在飞行员舱后面，穿过后防火墙的另一侧，只有一根长杆通向飞行员左肩后面的手柄，他避免了将燃油管线穿过客舱，消除了燃油管线在舱内破裂的可能性。
- en: "He did so, however, at a terrible cost to the human interface, because the\
    \ only way to switch tanks was to let go of the controls, twist your head to the\

    \ find the valve, and turn it. As the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)\
    \ discovered, it was difficult to do this without bracing yourself with your right\
    \ foot\x97by pressing the right rudder pedal all the way to the floor. And that's\

  zh: 他在飞行前对飞机进行预检时，将一根杆浸入燃油箱中以测试燃油水平。然而，他可能没有意识到，由于Long-EZ的放置方式，燃油倾向于向燃油箱加油口倾斜，给出了一个非常乐观的读数。
- en: The third method is adding fuel to the tanks, which Denver failed to do. Because
    the Long-EZ has very large tanks, the common practice is to add an amount of fuel
    suffient for the flight, plus a healthy margin. It may be John Denver was told

- en: '**The valve:** The builder not only placed the valve in a non-standard location,
    he also rotated it in such a way that turning the valve to the right turned on
    the left fuel tank. This ensured that a pilot unfamiliar with the aircraft, upon
    hearing the engine begin missing and spotting in his mirror that the left fuel
    tank was empty, would attempt to rotate the fuel valve to the right, away from
    the full tank, guaranteeing his destruction.'

- en: However, to those of us versed in even rudimentary human factors, it is easy
    to see that the design of this fuel system was a disaster waiting to happen, as
    was borne out not only by what Denver experienced, but by incidents reported by
