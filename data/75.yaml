  zh: 在我的一生中，我见过两次让我觉得革命性的技术演示。
- en: The first time was in 1980, when I was introduced to a graphical user interface—the
    forerunner of every modern operating system, including Windows. I sat with the
    person who had shown me the demo, a brilliant programmer named Charles Simonyi,
    and we immediately started brainstorming about all the things we could do with
    such a user-friendly approach to computing. Charles eventually joined Microsoft,
    Windows became the backbone of Microsoft, and the thinking we did after that demo
    helped set the company’s agenda for the next 15 years.

  zh: 第一次是在 1980 年，当我被介绍给了一个图形用户界面——每个现代操作系统的前身，包括 Windows。我与向我展示演示的人坐在一起，他是一位名叫查尔斯·西蒙伊的杰出程序员，我们立即开始了关于如何利用这种用户友好的计算方法的头脑风暴。查尔斯最终加入了微软，Windows
    成为了微软的支柱，我们在那次演示之后进行的思考帮助制定了公司未来 15 年的议程。
- en: 'The second big surprise came just last year. I’d been meeting with the team
    from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) since 2016 and was impressed by their steady
    progress. In mid-2022, I was so excited about their work that I gave them a challenge:
    train an artificial intelligence to pass an Advanced Placement biology exam. Make
    it capable of answering questions that it hasn’t been specifically trained for.
    (I picked AP Bio because the test is more than a simple regurgitation of scientific
    facts—it asks you to think critically about biology.) If you can do that, I said,
    then you’ll have made a true breakthrough.'

  zh: 第二个大惊喜是在去年。自 2016 年以来，我一直在与 [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) 团队会面，对他们稳步的进展印象深刻。到
    2022 年中期，我对他们的工作感到非常兴奋，所以我给了他们一个挑战：训练一个人工智能通过一门高级放置生物学考试。使其能够回答它没有专门训练过的问题。（我选择了
    AP 生物，因为这个考试不仅仅是对科学事实的简单重复，它要求你对生物学进行批判性思考。）如果你能做到这一点，我说，那么你将取得真正的突破。
- en: I thought the challenge would keep them busy for two or three years. They finished
    it in just a few months.

- en: In September, when I met with them again, I watched in awe as they asked GPT,
    their AI model, 60 multiple-choice questions from the AP Bio exam—and it got 59
    of them right. Then it wrote outstanding answers to six open-ended questions from
    the exam. We had an outside expert score the test, and GPT got a 5—the highest
    possible score, and the equivalent to [getting an A or A+](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/about-ap-scores/ap-score-scale-table)
    in a college-level biology course.

  zh: 九月份，当我再次与他们见面时，我惊叹地看着他们向 GPT，他们的人工智能模型，提出了 AP 生物考试的 60 道选择题，它答对了 59 道。然后它写下了对考试中的六道开放性问题的杰出答案。我们请了一位外部专家给考试打分，GPT
    得了 5 分——最高分，相当于在大学水平的生物课程中获得 A 或 A+。
- en: 'Once it had aced the test, we asked it a non-scientific question: “What do
    you say to a father with a sick child?” It wrote a thoughtful answer that was
    probably better than most of us in the room would have given. The whole experience
    was stunning.'

- en: The development of AI is as fundamental as the creation of the microprocessor,
    the personal computer, the Internet, and the mobile phone. It will change the
    way people work, learn, travel, get health care, and communicate with each other.
    Entire industries will reorient around it. Businesses will distinguish themselves
    by how well they use it.

- en: 'Philanthropy is my full-time job these days, and I’ve been thinking a lot about
    how—in addition to helping people be more productive—AI can reduce some of the
    world’s worst inequities. Globally, the worst inequity is in health: 5 million
    children under the age of 5 die every year. That’s down from 10 million two decades
    ago, but it’s still a shockingly high number. Nearly all of these children were
    born in poor countries and die of preventable causes like diarrhea or malaria.
    It’s hard to imagine a better use of AIs than saving the lives of children.'

  zh: 慈善事业是我目前的全职工作，我一直在思考如何——除了帮助人们更加高效地工作之外——人工智能如何减少世界上一些最严重的不平等现象。全球范围内，最严重的不平等现象出现在健康领域：每年有500万名5岁以下儿童死亡。这个数字比20年前的1000万有所下降，但仍然是一个令人震惊的高数字。几乎所有这些儿童都出生在贫困国家，并死于像腹泻或疟疾这样可以预防的疾病。很难想象有什么比拯救儿童生命更好的利用人工智能的方式了。

- en: In the United States, the best opportunity for reducing inequity is to improve
    education, particularly making sure that students succeed at math. The evidence
    shows that having basic math skills sets students up for success, no matter what
    career they choose. But achievement in math is going down across the country,
    especially for Black, Latino, and low-income students. AI can help turn that trend
    around.

  zh: 在美国，减少不平等的最佳机会是改善教育，特别是确保学生在数学上取得成功。证据表明，具备基本的数学技能可以让学生在选择任何职业时都取得成功。但全国范围内数学成绩正在下降，尤其是对于黑人、拉丁裔和低收入学生。人工智能可以帮助扭转这一趋势。
- en: Climate change is another issue where I’m convinced AI can make the world more
    equitable. The injustice of climate change is that the people who are suffering
    the most—the world’s poorest—are also the ones who did the least to contribute
    to the problem. I’m still thinking and learning about how AI can help, but later
    in this post I’ll suggest a few areas with a lot of potential.

  zh: 气候变化是另一个问题，我相信人工智能可以使世界更加公平。气候变化的不公正之处在于，最受苦的人——世界上最贫困的人——也是最少对问题做出贡献的人。我仍在思考和学习人工智能如何帮助，但在本文的后面，我将提出一些具有巨大潜力的领域。
- en: In short, I'm excited about the impact that AI will have on issues that the
    [Gates Foundation](http://gatesfoundation.org) works on, and the foundation will
    have much more to say about AI in the coming months. The world needs to make sure
    that everyone—and not just people who are well-off—benefits from artificial intelligence.
    Governments and philanthropy will need to play a major role in ensuring that it
    reduces inequity and doesn’t contribute to it. This is the priority for my own
    work related to AI.

  zh: 简而言之，我对人工智能对[盖茨基金会](http://gatesfoundation.org)致力于解决的问题产生的影响感到兴奋，基金会将在未来几个月内对人工智能发表更多看法。世界需要确保每个人——而不仅仅是富裕人群——都从人工智能中受益。政府和慈善事业需要在确保人工智能减少不平等并不助长不平等方面发挥重要作用。这是我与人工智能相关的工作的首要任务。
- en: Any new technology that’s so disruptive is bound to make people uneasy, and
    that’s certainly true with artificial intelligence. I understand why—it raises
    hard questions about the workforce, the legal system, privacy, bias, and more.
    AIs also make factual mistakes and experience [hallucinations](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)).
    Before I suggest some ways to mitigate the risks, I’ll define what I mean by AI,
    and I’ll go into more detail about some of the ways in which it will help empower
    people at work, save lives, and improve education.

  zh: 任何具有颠覆性的新技术都必然会让人感到不安，人工智能就是一个很好的例子。我理解为什么会这样——它引发了关于劳动力、法律体系、隐私、偏见等方面的艰难问题。人工智能也会出现事实错误并经历[幻觉](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence))。在我提出一些减轻风险的方法之前，我将定义我所说的人工智能，并更详细地讨论它将如何帮助赋予人们工作能力、拯救生命和改善教育的一些方式。
