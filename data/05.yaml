    You can use Microsoft Word and Google Docs to draft a business proposal, but they
    can’t help you send an email, share a selfie, analyze data, schedule a party,
    or buy movie tickets. And even the best sites have an incomplete understanding
    of your work, personal life, interests, and relationships and a limited ability

    only possible today with another human being, like a close friend or personal

  zh: 我认为没有任何一家公司会主导代理业务——将会有许多不同的AI引擎可用。今天，代理嵌入在文字处理器和电子表格等其他软件中，但最终它们将独立运行。尽管一些代理将是免费使用的（并由广告支持），但我认为您将为大多数代理付费，这意味着公司将有动力使代理为您工作，而不是为广告商工作。如果今年开始着手AI工作的公司数量是任何迹象，那么将会有大量的竞争，这将使代理非常廉价。
- en: But before the sophisticated agents I’m describing become a reality, we need
    to confront a number of questions about the technology and how we’ll use it. I’ve
    written before about the [issues that AI raises](https://www.gatesnotes.com/The-risks-of-AI-are-real-but-manageable),
    so I’ll focus specifically on agents here.

  zh: '**技术挑战**'
- en: Nobody has figured out yet what the data structure for an agent will look like.
    To create personal agents, we need a new type of database that can capture all
    the nuances of your interests and relationships and quickly recall the information
    while maintaining your privacy. We are already seeing new ways of storing information,
    such as vector databases, that may be better for storing data generated by machine
    learning models.

  zh: 目前还没有人弄清楚代理的数据结构会是什么样子。要创建个人代理，我们需要一种新型数据库，可以捕捉您兴趣和关系的所有细微差别，并在保持您的隐私的同时快速检索信息。我们已经看到了存储信息的新方法，比如矢量数据库，可能更适合存储机器学习模型生成的数据。
- en: Another open question is about how many agents people will interact with. Will
    your personal agent be separate from your therapist agent and your math tutor?
    If so, when will you want them to work with each other and when should they stay
    in their lanes?

  zh: 另一个悬而未决的问题是人们将与多少代理进行互动。您的个人代理会与您的治疗师代理和数学家教代理分开吗？如果是这样，那么您何时希望它们相互合作，何时应该各自留在自己的领域？

    your phone.”

  zh: “如果你的代理人需要与你联系，它会与你交谈或在你的手机上显示。”
- en: How will you interact with your agent? Companies are exploring various options
    including apps, glasses, pendants, pins, and even holograms. All of these are
    possibilities, but I think the first big breakthrough in human-agent interaction
    will be earbuds. If your agent needs to check in with you, it will speak to you
    or show up on your phone. (“Your flight is delayed. Do you want to wait, or can
    I help rebook it?”) If you want, it will monitor sound coming into your ear and
    enhance it by blocking out background noise, amplifying speech that’s hard to
    hear, or making it easier to understand someone who’s speaking with a heavy accent.

  zh: 你将如何与你的代理人互动？公司正在探索各种选项，包括应用程序、眼镜、吊坠、胸针，甚至全息图。所有这些都是可能性，但我认为人类与代理人互动的第一个重大突破将是耳机。如果你的代理人需要与你联系，它会与你交谈或在你的手机上显示。（“你的航班延误了。你想等待还是我可以帮你重新预订？”）如果你愿意，它会监控进入你耳朵的声音，并通过阻止背景噪音、放大难以听见的语音或使说话带有浓重口音的人更容易理解来增强声音。
- en: There are other challenges too. There isn’t yet a standard protocol that will
    allow agents to talk to each other. The cost needs to come down so agents are
    affordable for everyone. It needs to be easier to prompt the agent in a way that
    will give you the right answer. We need to prevent [hallucinations](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/business/ai-chatbots-hallucination.html),
    especially in areas like health where accuracy is super-important, and make sure
    that agents don’t harm people as a result of their biases. And we don’t want agents
    to be able to do things they’re not supposed to. (Although I worry less about
    rogue agents than about human criminals using agents for malign purposes.)

  zh: 还有其他挑战。目前还没有一种标准协议可以让代理人彼此交流。成本需要降低，以便代理人对每个人都是负担得起的。需要更容易地提示代理人以获得正确答案。我们需要防止[幻觉](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/business/ai-chatbots-hallucination.html)，特别是在健康等准确性非常重要的领域，确保代理人不会因为其偏见而伤害人们。我们不希望代理人能够做他们不应该做的事情。（尽管我更担心的是恶意代理人，而不是人类罪犯利用代理人进行恶意目的。）

    it’s being used appropriately? No one wants to start getting ads related to something

  zh: 但是你与代理人分享的数据归谁所有，你如何确保它被适当使用？没有人希望开始收到与他们告诉他们的治疗师代理人有关的广告。执法部门能否将你的代理人作为对你的证据？你的代理人何时会拒绝做对你或他人有害的事情？谁选择内置在代理人中的价值观？
- en: 'There’s also the question of how much information your agent should share.
    Suppose you want to see a friend: If your agent talks to theirs, you don’t want
    it to say, "Oh, she’s seeing other friends on Tuesday and doesn’t want to include
    you.” And if your agent helps you write emails for work, it will need to know
    that it shouldn’t use personal information about you or proprietary data from
    a previous job.'

  zh: 还有一个问题，你的代理人应该分享多少信息。假设你想见一个朋友：如果你的代理人与他们的代理人交谈，你不希望它说：“哦，她周二还要见其他朋友，不想包括你。”如果你的代理人帮助你为工作写邮件，它需要知道不应该使用关于你的个人信息或以前工作的专有数据。
- en: Many of these questions are already top-of-mind for the tech industry and legislators.
    I recently participated in a forum on AI with other technology leaders that was
    organized by Sen. Chuck Schumer and attended by many U.S. senators. We shared

- en: But other issues won’t be decided by companies and governments. For example,
    agents could affect how we interact with friends and family. Today, you can show
    someone that you care about them by remembering details about their life—say,
    their birthday. But when they know your agent likely reminded you about it and
    took care of sending flowers, will it be as meaningful for them?

- en: In the distant future, agents may even force humans to face profound questions
    about purpose. Imagine that agents become so good that everyone can have a high
    quality of life without working nearly as much. In a future like that, what would
    people do with their time? Would anyone still want to get an education when an
    agent has all the answers? Can you have a safe and thriving society when most
    people have a lot of free time on their hands?
